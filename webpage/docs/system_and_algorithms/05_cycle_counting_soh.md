# Cycle Counting and State of Health

## Introduction
Cycle Counting and State of Health (SoH) are pivotal components of Battery Management Systems (BMS). These metrics enable the effective monitoring of battery usage and health, ensuring optimal performance, reliability, and longevity. This documentation provides an in-depth, detailed, and seamless explanation of the methodologies, algorithms, and challenges associated with cycle counting and SoH estimation, offering insights suitable for industry professionals and engineers.

## Cycle Counting

### 1. Overview
Cycle counting determines the number of complete charge-discharge cycles a battery undergoes over its lifetime. Understanding the number of cycles is crucial for predicting battery degradation and estimating remaining life.

---

### 2. Defining a Battery Cycle
A cycle is defined as a full charge from a minimum State of Charge (SoC) (e.g., 20%) to a maximum SoC (e.g., 100%), followed by a discharge back to the starting SoC. Partial cycles are accumulated to represent equivalent full cycles.

#### Key Definitions
- **Charge Cycle:** The transition of a battery’s SoC from a low to a high value.
- **Discharge Cycle:** The reverse process of depleting the battery from a high SoC to a lower SoC.

#### Example
If a battery is discharged from 100% to 50% and then recharged to 100%, it is considered half a cycle. Two such operations would count as one full cycle.

| Cycle Phase | Start SoC (%) | End SoC (%) | Description                     |
|-------------|---------------|-------------|---------------------------------|
| Charging    | 20            | 100         | Full charge from 20% to 100%.    |
| Discharging | 100           | 20          | Full discharge from 100% to 20%. |

### 3. Challenges in Cycle Counting

#### 3.1 No Direct Measurement
Cycles cannot be directly measured by sensors; they must be inferred using algorithms based on current, voltage, and SoC.

#### 3.2 Nonlinear Battery Behavior
Factors like varying charge/discharge rates, temperature, and battery chemistry introduce complexity in defining and counting cycles.

#### 3.3 Duty Profiles
- **Charge Duty:** The total energy added to the battery during a charge event.
- **Discharge Duty:** The total energy removed from the battery during a discharge event.

These profiles help in accurately estimating partial and full cycles.

### 4. Cycle Counting Algorithm

#### Step 1: Monitoring SoC
Continuously monitor SoC using battery voltage and current sensors.

#### Step 2: Identifying Cycles
Define a full cycle as the SoC changing from a low value to a high value and back to the starting point:

$$
\text{Cycle Count} = \sum \frac{\Delta \text{SoC}}{100}
$$

#### Step 3: Accumulating Partial Cycles
Track incomplete cycles by summing fractional changes in SoC. For example:
- Discharge from 100% to 50% → 0.5 cycles.
- Charge from 50% to 100% → 0.5 cycles.
- **Total** = 1 full cycle.

#### Step 4: Logging and Updating
Maintain a counter to record accumulated cycles.

---

### 5. Duty Calculation for Enhanced Accuracy

#### Charging Duty
The charge duty reflects the energy added to the battery during a charging event:

$$
\text{Duty}_{\text{charge}} = \text{End SoC}_{\text{charge}} - \text{Start SoC}_{\text{charge}}
$$

#### Discharging Duty
The discharge duty reflects the energy drawn during discharging:

$$
\text{Duty}_{\text{discharge}} = \text{Start SoC}_{\text{discharge}} - \text{End SoC}_{\text{discharge}}
$$

#### Total Duty
The sum of charging and discharging duties helps refine cycle calculations:

$$
\text{Total Duty} = \text{Duty}_{\text{charge}} + \text{Duty}_{\text{discharge}}
$$

## State of Health (SoH)

### 1. Overview
State of Health (SoH) quantifies the current capacity of a battery compared to its original capacity when new. It serves as a measure of battery aging and remaining usability.

#### Formula
$$
\text{SoH} = \frac{\text{Remaining Capacity}}{\text{Rated Capacity}} \times 100
$$

---

### 2. Capacity Degradation
Battery capacity diminishes with usage due to cycle aging, temperature extremes, and internal resistance growth. The relationship between cycle count and capacity loss is often modeled using a Cycle vs. Capacity Loss Chart.

| Cycle Count | Remaining Capacity (% of Rated) |
|-------------|----------------------------------|
| 0           | 100%                             |
| 500         | 90%                              |
| 1000        | 80%                              |
| 1500        | 70%                              |

#### Lookup Table Implementation
The Cycle vs. Capacity Loss Chart is converted into a lookup table for algorithmic use:
1. Use the current cycle count as input.
2. Interpolate to find the remaining capacity.

---

### 3. SoH Estimation Algorithm

#### Step 1: Retrieve Cycle Count
Calculate or retrieve the total cycles completed using the cycle counting algorithm.

#### Step 2: Estimate Remaining Capacity
Map the cycle count to remaining capacity using the lookup table:

$$
\text{Remaining Capacity} = f(\text{Cycle Count})
$$

#### Step 3: Calculate SoH
Calculate SoH as the ratio of remaining capacity to rated capacity:

$$
\text{SoH} = \frac{\text{Remaining Capacity}}{\text{Rated Capacity}} \times 100
$$

---

### 4. Duty-Corrected SoH
Integrating duty calculations enhances the accuracy of SoH estimation:

$$
\text{SoH}_{\text{corrected}} = \frac{\text{Remaining Capacity}_{\text{duty}}}{\text{Rated Capacity}} \times 100
$$

---

### 5. MATLAB Implementation of SoH

#### Algorithm Design
1. Create a Cycle vs. Capacity Loss Lookup Table.
2. Implement the SoH estimation algorithm using cycle count and duty data.

#### Pseudo-Code

```matlab
% Define battery parameters
rated_capacity = 100; % in Ah
cycle_count = 0;

% Define Lookup Table (Cycle vs Capacity Loss)
lookup_table = [0, 100; 500, 90; 1000, 80; 1500, 70];

% Cycle Counting Algorithm
if start_soc < end_soc
    cycle_increment = (end_soc - start_soc) / 100;
    cycle_count = cycle_count + cycle_increment;
end

% SoH Estimation
remaining_capacity = interp1(lookup_table(:,1), lookup_table(:,2), cycle_count, 'linear', 'extrap');
SoH = (remaining_capacity / rated_capacity) * 100;

% Output Results
disp(['Current SoH: ', num2str(SoH), '%']);
```
