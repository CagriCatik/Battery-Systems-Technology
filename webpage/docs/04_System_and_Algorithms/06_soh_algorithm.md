# State of Health (SoH) Algorithm and Implementation

## Introduction
The State of Health (SoH) algorithm is an essential component of a Battery Management System (BMS), providing insights into the battery's condition and predicting its remaining usable capacity. This documentation delves into the theory, methodology, and technical implementation of SoH estimation, incorporating best practices and addressing challenges. The focus is on creating a seamless, detailed, and practical explanation for engineers and industry professionals.

## State of Health (SoH) Overview

### 1. Definition
State of Health (SoH) quantifies the battery's ability to store and deliver energy compared to its rated capacity at the time of manufacture. SoH provides a measure of battery degradation over time due to aging, cycle usage, and environmental conditions.

$$
\text{SoH} = \frac{\text{Remaining Capacity}}{\text{Rated Capacity}} \times 100
$$

### 2. Importance
- Performance Monitoring: Ensures the battery operates within safe and optimal conditions.
- Predictive Maintenance: Alerts users when the battery requires servicing or replacement.
- Degradation Tracking: Helps in lifecycle analysis and warranty claims.

## Cycle Dependency in SoH Estimation

### 1. Cycle Aging
Battery degradation is directly influenced by the number of charge-discharge cycles completed. Each cycle contributes to a loss in the battery's capacity.

| Cycle Count | Remaining Capacity (% of Rated) |
|-----------------|-------------------------------------|
| 0               | 100%                                |
| 500             | 90%                                 |
| 1000            | 80%                                 |
| 2000            | 70%                                 |

### 2. Depth of Discharge (DoD)
The depth of discharge (DoD) represents the percentage of the battery's total capacity used in a single discharge event. Higher DoD cycles contribute more to capacity degradation.

- Full Cycle: A full charge from 0% to 100% SoC.
- Partial Cycle: A charge or discharge event within a fraction of the total capacity (e.g., 30% to 80%).

## SoH Algorithm Framework

### 1. Key Components
The SoH algorithm comprises several interconnected components:
- Cycle Counting Algorithm: Tracks the number of charge-discharge cycles, including partial cycles.
- Cycle vs. Capacity Loss Lookup Table: Maps the number of cycles to the corresponding capacity degradation.
- Dynamic SoH Estimation: Adjusts SoH based on real-time data and past usage.

### 3. Algorithm Steps

#### Step 1: Calculate Equivalent Cycles
To accurately track usage, partial cycles are aggregated into equivalent full cycles.

$$
\text{Equivalent Cycles} = \sum \frac{\text{Cycle Contribution}}{1.0}
$$

- Cycle Contribution:

$$
\text{Cycle Contribution} = 1 - \text{Charge Duty (A)} - \text{Discharge Duty (B)}
$$

Where \( A \) and \( B \) represent the charge and discharge fractions in decimal format (e.g., 50% = 0.5).

#### Step 2: Retrieve Capacity Loss
Use the cumulative cycle count as an input to a pre-defined Cycle vs. Capacity Loss Lookup Table to estimate the remaining capacity.

#### Step 3: Compute SoH
Calculate SoH using the formula:

$$
\text{SoH} = \frac{\text{Remaining Capacity}}{\text{Rated Capacity}} \times 100
$$

#### Step 4: Cumulative Tracking
- Store cumulative cycle data in non-volatile memory to ensure long-term tracking.
- Periodically update and calibrate SoH based on real-time and historical data.

## Algorithm Design: Advanced Implementation

### 1. Data Storage and Memory Management
- Memory Requirements: Non-volatile memory (e.g., EEPROM, flash) to store cycle counts and capacity degradation data.
- Optimization: Compress historical data or periodically reset less significant cycle data.

### 2. Handling Partial Cycles

#### Duty Calculation
- Charge Duty:

$$
\text{Duty}_{\text{charge}} = \frac{\text{End SoC}_{\text{charge}} - \text{Start SoC}_{\text{charge}}}{100}
$$

- Discharge Duty:

$$
\text{Duty}_{\text{discharge}} = \frac{\text{Start SoC}_{\text{discharge}} - \text{End SoC}_{\text{discharge}}}{100}
$$

#### Cycle Aggregation
Sum the duties to calculate the equivalent full cycles:

$$
\text{Cycle Count} = \text{Previous Cycles} + \frac{\text{Duty}_{\text{charge}} + \text{Duty}_{\text{discharge}}}{1.0}
$$

### 3. MATLAB Implementation

#### Pseudo-Code
```matlab
% Define battery parameters
rated_capacity = 100; % in Ah
current_cycles = 0; % Initialize total cycles

% Define Lookup Table (Cycle vs Capacity Loss)
lookup_table = [0, 100; 500, 90; 1000, 80; 2000, 70]; % Cycle vs % Capacity

% Input: Charge and Discharge Duty
charge_duty = 0.4; % 40% charge duty
discharge_duty = 0.5; % 50% discharge duty

% Step 1: Calculate Equivalent Cycles
cycle_contribution = 1 - charge_duty - discharge_duty;
current_cycles = current_cycles + cycle_contribution;

% Step 2: Retrieve Capacity Loss
remaining_capacity = interp1(lookup_table(:,1), lookup_table(:,2), current_cycles, 'linear', 'extrap');

% Step 3: Compute State of Health (SoH)
SoH = (remaining_capacity / rated_capacity) * 100;

% Output Results
disp(['Total Cycles: ', num2str(current_cycles)]);
disp(['Remaining Capacity: ', num2str(remaining_capacity), ' Ah']);
disp(['State of Health (SoH): ', num2str(SoH), '%']);
```

## Challenges in SoH Estimation

### 1. Sensor Inaccuracies
Voltage and current sensor noise or drift can impact the accuracy of duty and cycle calculations.

#### Mitigation:
- Implement filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman filters).
- Periodically calibrate sensors with reference values.

### 2. Environmental Variability
Temperature and load variations can accelerate degradation unpredictably.

#### Mitigation:
- Use temperature-compensated SoH models.
- Introduce adaptive algorithms that account for environmental factors.

### 3. Long-Term Data Management
Storing large amounts of cycle data in non-volatile memory is resource-intensive.

#### Mitigation:
- Periodically aggregate historical data.
- Store only critical points (e.g., significant degradation milestones).
