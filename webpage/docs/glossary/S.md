- **State of Charge (SoC)**: A measure of the remaining charge in a battery relative to its capacity.

- **State of Health (SoH)**: An assessment of a battery's condition and its ability to store and deliver energy compared to its original state.

- **Solid-State Battery**: A battery that uses solid electrolytes instead of liquids, enhancing safety and energy density.  

- **State of Charge (SoC)**: A measure of the remaining energy in a battery relative to its total capacity.

- **State of Health (SoH)**: An assessment of a battery's condition and its ability to store and deliver energy compared to its original state.

- **Slip**: The difference between the synchronous speed of the stator's magnetic field and the actual speed of the rotor, expressed as a percentage of synchronous speed.

- **Squirrel Cage Rotor**: A type of rotor design in ASMs consisting of conductive bars short-circuited by end rings, known for simplicity and durability.

- **Silicon Carbide (SiC)**: A wide bandgap semiconductor material used in high-efficiency power electronics.

- **Space Vector Modulation (SVM)**: An advanced pulse-width modulation (PWM) technique used to minimize harmonic distortion and maximize inverter efficiency.

- **State of Charge (SoC)**: A measure of the battery's current charge level as a percentage of its total capacity.

- **State of Health (SoH)**: An indicator of the overall condition and remaining lifespan of the battery.
