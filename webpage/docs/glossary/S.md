- **State of Charge (SoC)**: A measure of the remaining charge in a battery relative to its total capacity.
- **State of Health (SoH)**: An indicator of a battery's condition, including its ability to store and deliver energy compared to its original state and lifespan.
- **Solid-State Battery**: A battery utilizing solid electrolytes instead of liquids, providing enhanced safety and energy density.  
- **Slip**: The difference between the synchronous speed of a stator's magnetic field and the rotor's actual speed, expressed as a percentage of synchronous speed.
- **Squirrel Cage Rotor**: A rotor design in asynchronous motors (ASMs), composed of conductive bars short-circuited by end rings, valued for simplicity and durability.
- **Silicon Carbide (SiC)**: A wide bandgap semiconductor material used in high-efficiency power electronics.
- **Space Vector Modulation (SVM)**: An advanced pulse-width modulation (PWM) method to reduce harmonic distortion and maximize inverter efficiency.
