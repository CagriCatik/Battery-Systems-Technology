- **Axial Flux Motor**: A type of electric motor where the magnetic flux runs parallel to the motor's axis, allowing for higher torque density and compact design.
- **Asynchronous Motor (ASM)**: An electric motor where the rotor does not rotate at the same speed as the stator's rotating magnetic field. Also known as an Induction Motor.
- **Anode**: The negative electrode of a battery where oxidation occurs.
