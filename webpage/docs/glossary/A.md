- **Axial Flux Motor**: A type of electric motor where the magnetic flux runs parallel to the motor's axis, allowing for higher torque density and compact design.
- **Asynchronous Motor (ASM)**: An electric motor where the rotor does not rotate at the same speed as the stator's rotating magnetic field. Also known as an Induction Motor.




- **Onboard Charger (OBC)**: A system that converts AC power from the grid into DC power for charging the vehicle's battery.
- **Field-Oriented Control (FOC)**: An advanced motor control technique that independently controls torque and magnetic flux for optimal motor performance.



- **Gallium Nitride (GaN)**: A wide bandgap semiconductor material known for high-frequency performance and compact size.

- **Electromagnetic Compatibility (EMC)**: The ability of electrical systems to operate without causing or being affected by electromagnetic interference (EMI).
- **Bidirectional Converter**: A device that allows energy flow in both directions, enabling regenerative braking and V2G/V2H functionalities.
