- **Anode**: The negative electrode of a battery where oxidation occurs.  

- **Electrolyte**: A conductive medium that allows ion flow between the anode and cathode.  
- **Thermal Runaway**: An uncontrolled temperature increase in a battery that can lead to fire or explosion.  
- **State of Charge (SoC)**: A measure of the battery's current charge level as a percentage of its total capacity.  
- **State of Health (SoH)**: An indicator of the overall condition and remaining lifespan of the battery.  
- **Regeneration (Rekuperation)**: Recovery of energy by converting kinetic energy into electrical energy, for example, during braking.
