# Prismatic Module

Prismatic cells are one of the simplest formats for constructing battery packs. Encased in a rigid metal or hard plastic enclosure, prismatic cells offer a flat and compact design, making them ideal for high-density applications. Their modularity and ease of assembly contribute to their popularity in automotive and stationary energy storage solutions.

## Prismatic Battery Modules

### Components of a Prismatic Module

A prismatic module consists of the following key components:
- Prismatic Cells:
  - Flat, rectangular cells encased in aluminum or hard plastic.
  - Common chemistries include lithium-ion and lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO₄).
- Bus Bars:
  - Connect cells in series or parallel configurations.
- Cooling Plates:
  - Thin sheets with internal ducts for thermal management.
- Compression Plates (Optional):
  - Provide structural support and counteract swelling.
- Voltage and Temperature Sensors:
  - Monitor cell performance and ensure safety.
- Module Enclosure:
  - Protects the assembly from external impacts and environmental conditions.

### Electrical Connections

Electrical connections in prismatic modules are straightforward:
- Series and Parallel Configurations:
  - Series connections increase voltage.
  - Parallel connections increase capacity.
- Bus Bars:
  - Conductive strips welded or bolted to connect cells.
  - Simplified design compared to cylindrical or pouch cells.
- Voltage and Temperature Monitoring:
  - Sensors measure voltage and temperature across cells.
  - Data is relayed to the Battery Management System (BMS) for analysis.

### Mechanical Design

Prismatic cells are inherently robust due to their rigid casing, reducing the need for complex mechanical structures.

- Compression Plates:
  - Used in some designs to apply uniform pressure and counteract cell swelling.
  - Not always required due to the structural integrity of prismatic cells.
- Enclosure Design:
  - Modules are housed in compact casings for additional mechanical protection.
- Stacking Configurations:
  - Cells can be stacked vertically or horizontally, depending on space and design requirements.

## Thermal Management

Thermal management is critical to ensure safety and maintain performance in prismatic modules.

### Cooling Plate Design

- Structure:
  - Cooling plates are thin metal sheets with internal ducts.
  - Ducts facilitate coolant flow to dissipate heat efficiently.
- Coolant Flow:
  - Coolant enters through an inlet, flows through ducts, and exits via an outlet.
- Material:
  - High thermal conductivity materials like aluminum or copper are used.

### Cooling Process

1. Heat Transfer:
   - Cells transfer heat to the cooling plate via conduction.
   - Coolant absorbs heat and carries it away from the cells.
2. Internal Ducts:
   - Optimized duct paths ensure uniform cooling across the plate.
3. Cooling Efficiency:
   - Thermal gradients are minimized, preventing hotspots and maintaining cell lifespan.

## Assembly Process

### Steps to Assemble a Prismatic Battery Pack

1. Cell Preparation:
   - Inspect and test cells for quality assurance.
2. Electrical Connections:
   - Weld or bolt bus bars to connect cells in series or parallel.
3. Cooling Plate Integration:
   - Place cells on or integrate them with cooling plates.
4. Compression Plates (Optional):
   - Add compression plates to counteract potential swelling.
5. Sensor Installation:
   - Attach voltage and temperature sensors.
6. Enclosure:
   - Secure the assembly within a protective casing.

### Cooling Plate Integration

Cooling plates are essential for thermal management:
- Positioned adjacent to or beneath the cells.
- Designed with internal ducts to channel coolant efficiently.
- Enable uniform heat dissipation across the module.
