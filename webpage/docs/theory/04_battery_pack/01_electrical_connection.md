## Types of Cell Connections

Understanding the various ways to connect battery cells is fundamental to designing effective battery systems. The primary configurations are series connections, parallel connections, and a combination of both.

### 1. Series Connections

**Principle:**  
In a series connection, the positive terminal of one cell is connected to the negative terminal of the next cell. This arrangement effectively stacks the cells to increase the overall voltage of the battery pack.

**Effect on System Parameters:**

- **Voltage:** Increases with each added cell.
- **Current Capacity:** Remains the same as a single cell.

**Mathematical Representation:**
```text
V_total = V_cell × n
I_total = I_cell
```
- `V_total`: Total pack voltage  
- `V_cell`: Voltage of a single cell  
- `n`: Number of cells in series  
- `I_cell`: Current capacity of a single cell  

**Example:**  
Consider a series of 4 cells, each rated at 3.6 V and 3400 mAh:

    I_total = current_cell
    return V_total, I_total

# Example Usage
V_cell = 3.6  # volts
I_cell = 3400  # mAh
n = 4
V_total, I_total = calculate_series(V_cell, I_cell, n)
print(f"Total Voltage: {V_total} V")
print(f"Total Capacity: {I_total} mAh")
```

print(f"Total Capacity: {I_total} mAh")
```

**Output:**
```
Total Voltage: 3.6 V
Total Capacity: 10200 mAh
```

A series-parallel combination leverages both series and parallel connections to achieve higher voltage and increased current capacity simultaneously. This hybrid approach allows for flexible and scalable battery pack designs.

**Configuration Steps:**

1. **Connect Cells in Series:** Establish the desired voltage by connecting cells in a series configuration.
2. **Connect Series Strings in Parallel:** Increase the overall capacity by connecting multiple series strings in parallel.

**Mathematical Representation:**
```text
V_total = V_cell × n_series
I_total = I_cell × n_parallel
```
