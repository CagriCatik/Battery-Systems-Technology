### Cooling Mechanism

The cooling process involves direct thermal conduction from cells to cooling plates.

1. Heat Transfer:
   - Cells transfer heat to the cooling plate.
   - Coolant absorbs this heat and carries it away.
2. Coolant Flow:
   - Pumped through the internal ducts.
   - Removes heat efficiently even under high load.
3. Temperature Gradients:
   - Designed to maintain uniform cell temperatures.
   - Prevents thermal runaway and enhances cell lifespan.
