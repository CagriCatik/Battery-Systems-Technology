# Functional Requirements

This chapter details the operational requirements for the Battery Management System (BMS), ensuring that the system performs reliably under a range of conditions. Each requirement is designed to be clear, measurable, and verifiable, with corresponding test specifications that validate system behavior. The following sections cover the primary functional areas: Voltage Monitoring, Current Monitoring, and Temperature Management.

## Voltage Monitoring

### **Requirement**
The BMS **must** measure the voltage of each cell with an accuracy of ±0.01 V. Additionally, the system **must** issue warnings if any cell voltage falls below 2.5 V or exceeds 4.2 V.

### **Rationale**
Accurate voltage monitoring is critical to maintaining battery health and ensuring safe operation. The specified voltage thresholds help prevent cell over-discharge and overcharge, both of which can lead to reduced battery life or hazardous conditions.

### **Test Specification**

- **Test Case 1.1:**  
  **Objective:** Verify measurement accuracy.  
  **Procedure:** Input a range of cell voltages from 2.5 V to 4.2 V in increments of 0.01 V.  
  **Expected Outcome:** The BMS must correctly display the input voltage within the tolerance limit of ±0.01 V.

- **Test Case 1.2:**  
  **Objective:** Validate low voltage warning functionality.  
  **Procedure:** Simulate a scenario where a cell voltage falls below 2.5 V.  
  **Expected Outcome:** The BMS must generate a warning indicating that the voltage is below the safe operating threshold.

- **Test Case 1.3:**  
  **Objective:** Validate high voltage warning functionality.  
  **Procedure:** Simulate a scenario where a cell voltage exceeds 4.2 V.  
  **Expected Outcome:** The BMS must generate a warning indicating that the voltage is above the safe operating threshold.

## Current Monitoring

### **Requirement**
The BMS **must** continuously monitor both charging and discharging currents, ensuring that these currents remain within a specified range of -50 A to +50 A.

### **Rationale**
Continuous current monitoring is vital to detect anomalies such as overcurrent conditions, which could lead to thermal runaway or damage to the battery. Maintaining current within the specified range helps ensure both safety and optimal battery performance.

### **Test Specification**

- **Test Case 2.1:**  
  **Objective:** Verify the accuracy of current measurement.  
  **Procedure:** Input charging and discharging currents in increments of 5 A within the range of -50 A to +50 A.  
  **Expected Outcome:** The BMS must accurately record and display each current value, confirming adherence to the specified measurement accuracy.

- **Test Case 2.2:**  
  **Objective:** Validate system response to out-of-range current values.  
  **Procedure:** Simulate current values that exceed the specified range (-50 A to +50 A).  
  **Expected Outcome:** The BMS must detect the anomaly and initiate appropriate protective measures, such as disconnecting the load or triggering an alert.

## Temperature Management

### **Requirement**
The BMS **must** monitor the temperature of each cell and the overall battery with an accuracy of ±2 °C. Furthermore, the system **must** initiate a shutdown if any cell or the overall battery temperature exceeds 60 °C or drops below -20 °C.

### **Rationale**
Temperature is a critical parameter affecting battery performance and safety. Accurate temperature monitoring helps prevent conditions that could lead to thermal runaway or impaired battery function. The shutdown thresholds protect the battery from operating in potentially damaging or hazardous temperature conditions.

### **Test Specification**

- **Test Case 3.1:**  
  **Objective:** Verify temperature measurement accuracy.  
  **Procedure:** Simulate a range of temperatures between -20 °C and 60 °C.  
  **Expected Outcome:** The BMS must measure and display temperatures within an accuracy of ±2 °C.

- **Test Case 3.2:**  
  **Objective:** Validate the shutdown mechanism under extreme temperature conditions.  
  **Procedure:** Simulate temperature conditions that exceed the safe operating range (i.e., above 60 °C or below -20 °C).  
  **Expected Outcome:** The BMS must initiate a shutdown procedure to prevent damage to the battery and ensure overall system safety.

## Conclusion

The functional requirements specified in this chapter ensure that the BMS operates as intended under normal and extreme conditions. By rigorously defining the performance parameters for voltage, current, and temperature monitoring, and by providing detailed test specifications, we establish a robust framework for verifying system functionality. These requirements not only help to maintain battery health and extend service life but also ensure that the BMS meets critical safety standards, thereby supporting the overall reliability and safety of the automotive system.
