# Best Practices for Automotive Requirements

A systematic approach to writing automotive requirements is essential for ensuring system reliability, safety, and regulatory compliance. The best practices outlined in this chapter are the result of extensive industry experience and continuous improvement. They have been refined to promote clarity, precision, and efficiency throughout the entire system development lifecycle. Adhering to these practices not only mitigates risks but also fosters effective communication and collaboration among stakeholders.

## Clarity and Precision

### **Unambiguous Language**
- **Objective:**  
  Each requirement must be expressed in clear and concise language that leaves no room for multiple interpretations.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Use plain language and avoid jargon where possible.
  - Structure sentences to focus on one concept at a time.
  - Verify that each requirement can only be understood in one way, even by stakeholders from non-technical backgrounds.

### **Defined Terminology**
- **Objective:**  
  Consistent understanding is critical. All technical terms and abbreviations should be clearly defined.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Include a glossary of terms in the documentation.
  - Cross-reference definitions where the same terminology appears.
  - Update the glossary as new terms or acronyms are introduced.

## Completeness and Consistency

### **Comprehensive Coverage**
- **Objective:**  
  Every facet of the system—be it functional, safety-related, or performance-based—must be addressed.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Conduct a thorough review of system requirements to ensure no critical elements are omitted.
  - Use checklists or requirement coverage matrices to verify that all system aspects are captured.
  - Periodically review the requirements as the system evolves to incorporate any new aspects.

### **Internal Consistency**
- **Objective:**  
  Ensure that the requirements are harmonious and free of contradictions.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Perform cross-referencing within the document to identify and resolve conflicts.
  - Involve cross-disciplinary teams (e.g., design, testing, safety) in review sessions.
  - Employ automated tools, when available, to detect inconsistencies across large requirement sets.

## Traceability

### **Traceability Matrix**
- **Objective:**  
  Maintain a clear, bi-directional link between each requirement and its corresponding design elements, test cases, and source documentation.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Develop a traceability matrix that includes columns for the requirement ID, source (customer needs, regulatory standards, etc.), design reference, implementation details, and verification methods.
  - Regularly update the matrix to reflect changes in requirements or system design.
  - Use the matrix during audits and reviews to ensure every requirement has been fully addressed and verified.

### **Source Traceability**
- **Objective:**  
  Each requirement should be traceable back to its original stakeholder or standard to ensure accountability.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Document the origin of every requirement (e.g., customer interviews, regulatory documents).
  - Include reference numbers or identifiers that correspond to external standards or internal guidelines.
  - Ensure that updates or changes to requirements are reviewed in context with their original source, maintaining a clear audit trail.

## Testability

### **Measurable and Verifiable**
- **Objective:**  
  Requirements must be written in a way that facilitates objective measurement and validation.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Define quantifiable parameters (e.g., timing constraints, voltage thresholds, temperature ranges).
  - Ensure that every requirement has clear, measurable criteria.
  - Design requirements so that the associated tests can be automated or conducted under repeatable conditions.

### **Clear Acceptance Criteria**
- **Objective:**  
  Establish explicit criteria for determining whether a requirement has been met.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Develop specific, detailed acceptance criteria for each requirement.
  - Include pass/fail thresholds and test methods.
  - Review acceptance criteria with the testing and quality assurance teams to ensure feasibility and completeness.

## Realistic and Achievable

### **Feasibility Assessment**
- **Objective:**  
  Evaluate the technical, temporal, and financial viability of each requirement before it is finalized.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Perform feasibility studies that consider current technology, resource availability, and project timelines.
  - Involve engineering teams to assess the practicality of each requirement.
  - Adjust requirements based on feasibility studies to avoid unattainable goals.

### **Practical Implementation**
- **Objective:**  
  Ensure that every requirement can be practically implemented with the current state of technology and resources.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Validate that the proposed solutions align with available hardware, software, and process capabilities.
  - Engage with technology providers and cross-functional teams during the requirement drafting process.
  - Continuously monitor technological advancements and update requirements to leverage new capabilities where appropriate.

## Modularity

### **Structured Organization**
- **Objective:**  
  Organize requirements into well-defined, manageable modules to facilitate maintenance, updates, and scalability.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Categorize requirements based on system functions (e.g., power management, communication, diagnostics).
  - Develop modular sections that can be independently developed, tested, and validated.
  - Ensure that each module clearly defines its scope and interfaces with other modules.

### **Independent Units**
- **Objective:**  
  Design requirements to be as independent as possible to minimize interdependencies and simplify testing.
- **Implementation:**  
  - Identify potential interdependencies early in the requirement development process.
  - Structure requirements so that each module can operate with minimal reliance on others.
  - Use standard interfaces and protocols to ensure that independent modules can integrate seamlessly.
