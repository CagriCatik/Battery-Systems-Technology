# Closed-Loop Testing

## **1. Introduction to Closed-Loop Testing**

Closed-loop testing is a comprehensive validation approach that ensures the entire Battery Management System (BMS) Electronic Control Unit (ECU) operates correctly within its intended environment. By integrating the BMS ECU with a plant model‚Äîcomprising components such as the battery pack, charger, and load‚Äîclosed-loop testing simulates real-world interactions and scenarios. This method is pivotal for verifying system-level functionality, safety, and performance, particularly in safety-critical applications like electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

### **Key Objectives of Closed-Loop Testing**

1. **Test Interactions**:
   - **Function**: Validates the dynamic interactions between the BMS controller and physical components (e.g., battery cells, chargers).
   - **Importance**: Ensures that commands from the BMS lead to expected responses from the hardware, maintaining system stability and safety.

2. **Real-World Scenarios**:
   - **Function**: Simulates various operational scenarios such as charging, discharging, and fault conditions.
   - **Importance**: Tests the BMS's ability to handle typical and extreme conditions, ensuring robust performance under diverse circumstances.

3. **Non-Intrusive Monitoring**:
   - **Function**: Utilizes observers to monitor internal signals and states without altering the model's interfaces.
   - **Importance**: Allows for detailed inspection and validation of the system's internal logic and behavior without impacting its operational integrity.

By implementing closed-loop testing, developers can achieve a holistic validation of the BMS, ensuring that both the control algorithms and their interactions with physical components function seamlessly together.

   % Define signal paths
   chargeCurrentPath = 'BMS_ECU/Current_Power_Limits/Charge_Current_Limit';
   dischargeCurrentPath = 'BMS_ECU/Current_Power_Limits/Discharge_Current_Limit';
   
   % Add signals to observer
   Simulink.Observer.addSignal(testHarness, 'Internal_Observer', chargeCurrentPath);
   Simulink.Observer.addSignal(testHarness, 'Internal_Observer', dischargeCurrentPath);
   
   disp('Internal signals added to the observer.');
   ```
   
   *Figure 4: Selecting Internal Signals for Observation*

   % Define verification conditions
   assessmentBlock = [testHarness, '/Current_Limits_Assessment'];
   
   % Add verify statements
   Simulink.Test.Assessment.addVerify(assessmentBlock, 'Charge_Current_Limit < 50', 'Must stay below 50A');
   Simulink.Test.Assessment.addVerify(assessmentBlock, 'Discharge_Current_Limit > 10', 'Must stay above 10A');
   
   disp('Verify statements defined in Test Assessment block.');
   ```
   
   *Figure 8: Defining Verify Statements in Test Assessment*

### **4.2 Analyzing Results**

   % Open Diagnostic Viewer
   Simulink.Test.TestManager.openDiagnosticViewer(testSuite);
   
   disp('Diagnostic Viewer opened for assessment result analysis.');
   ```
   
   *Figure 9: Opening Diagnostic Viewer for Assessment Results*

2. **Failure Diagnostics**:
   - **Function**: Highlights specific instances where `verify` conditions were not met.
   - **Example Failure**:
     ```plaintext
     FAIL: Charge_Current_Limit exceeded 50A at t=12.5s.

   % Retrieve diagnostics
   diagnostics = Simulink.Test.TestManager.getDiagnosticReport(testSuite);
   
   % Display diagnostics
   disp('Diagnostics Report:');
   disp(diagnostics);
   ```

## **7. Example: Validating Current Limits**

To illustrate the application of closed-loop testing, consider an example focused on validating the BMS's charge and discharge current limits. This example demonstrates how to set up test scenarios, monitor internal signals, define assessments, and analyze results to ensure that the BMS operates within safe and efficient parameters.

### **7.1 Test Scenario**

**Objective**: Ensure that the BMS maintains charge and discharge currents within specified safe limits during driving operations.

**Steps**:

1. **Inject a Drive Cycle with Aggressive Acceleration**:
   - **Action**: Use the Test Sequence Block to define a drive cycle that includes rapid acceleration phases to test the BMS's ability to handle high current demands.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Set the system state to `DRIVING` with SOC starting above 30%.
     - Simulate aggressive acceleration events that demand higher charge and discharge currents.
   
2. **Use Observers to Monitor Current Limits**:
   - **Action**: Observe the `Charge_Current_Limit` and `Discharge_Current_Limit` signals to ensure they remain within predefined thresholds.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Connect observers to the relevant internal signals within the BMS ECU.
     - Ensure that these signals are logged and available for assessment.
   
3. **Verify Limits via Test Assessment Blocks**:
   - **Action**: Define and execute `verify` statements to automatically check that current limits are not exceeded during the test run.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Configure Test Assessment blocks with conditions like `Charge_Current_Limit < 50A` and `Discharge_Current_Limit > 10A`.
     - Run the test harness and monitor assessment results for compliance.

**Test Scenario Configuration Example**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Code Snippet: Configuring Test Scenario for Current Limits
testHarness = 'BMS_ClosedLoop_Test_Harness';

% Define aggressive acceleration drive cycle
driveCycleData = [
    struct('time', 0, 'State', 'STANDBY', 'SOC', 35, 'cell_temp', 40),
    struct('time', 10, 'State', 'DRIVING', 'SOC', 35, 'cell_temp', 40),

    struct('time', 40, 'State', 'DRIVING', 'SOC', 32, 'cell_temp', 44),
    struct('time', 50, 'State', 'FAULT', 'SOC', 32, 'cell_temp', 46)
];

% Configure Test Sequence Block
set_param([testHarness, '/Test_Sequence'], 'Sequence', driveCycleData);
