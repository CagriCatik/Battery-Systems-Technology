**Consistency Check Example**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Function: Validating Block Parameters Against Requirements
function validateBlockParameters(block_path, requirement_id, expected_params)
    % Locate the Simulink block
    blk = get_param(block_path, 'Handle');
    
    % Retrieve linked requirements
    reqs = Simulink.Requirements.getLinkedRequirements(blk);
    
    % Find the specific requirement
    req = reqs(strcmp({reqs.ID}, requirement_id));
    
    if isempty(req)
        disp(['No requirement linked to block ' block_path]);
        return;
    end
    
    % Compare block parameters with expected parameters from requirement
    param_names = fieldnames(expected_params);
    for i = 1:length(param_names)
        param = param_names{i};
        expected_value = expected_params.(param);
        actual_value = get_param(blk, param);
        if ~isequal(actual_value, expected_value)
            fprintf('Parameter mismatch in %s: Expected %s, Found %s\n', param, num2str(expected_value), num2str(actual_value));
        else
            fprintf('Parameter %s matches expected value.\n', param);
        end
    end
end
```
