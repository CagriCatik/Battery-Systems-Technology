# Managing Requirements

## **1. Introduction to Requirements Management**  
Effective requirements management is critical for Battery Management System (BMS) development to avoid project failures caused by incomplete, inconsistent, or ambiguous specifications. **Simulink** streamlines this process by:  
- **Direct Import/Export**: Enables seamless integration with external tools such as Microsoft Word, Excel, and IBM DOORS.  
- **Bi-Directional Traceability**: Supports linking requirements to design elements and vice versa, ensuring consistency.  
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Automatically detects and synchronizes updates from external sources, keeping the model aligned with the latest requirements.

## **2. Importing and Exporting Requirements**  
### **2.1 Supported Formats**  
- **External Sources**: Microsoft Word, Excel, and IBM DOORS.  
- **Standard Format**: ReqIF (Requirements Interchange Format) for compatibility with most tools.  

### **2.2 Import Process**  
1. **Open Requirements Manager**:  
   - Navigate to *Apps > Model Verification, Validation, and Test > Requirements Manager*.  
2. **Import Requirements**:  
   - Select *Import > Browse* to choose a Word, Excel, or DOORS file.  
   - Choose **Rich Text** or **Plain Text** formatting for the imported requirements.  
   - Name the requirement set and enable updates from the source to ensure real-time synchronization.  
3. **Synchronize Changes**:  
   - Simulink detects updates in the source document (e.g., a modified Word file) and displays an update icon.  
   - Click *Update* to synchronize changes in Simulink, ensuring the model reflects the latest requirements.  

### **2.3 Exporting Requirements**  
- **Export Process**: Modified or new requirements created in Simulink can be exported back to ReqIF or the original formats (e.g., Word, Excel).  
- **Use Case**: Useful for sharing updated requirements with stakeholders or integrating changes into external tools.

## **3. Authoring Requirements in Simulink**  
### **3.1 Creating Requirements**  
1. **New Requirement Set**:  
   - In the *Requirements Editor*, select *Add > Requirement Set* to create a new set of requirements.  
2. **Define Hierarchy**:  
   - Add parent and child requirements to create a structured hierarchy.  
   - Example:  
     ```plaintext  
     BMS_Requirements (Parent)  
     â”œâ”€ Input_Interfaces (Child)  
     â”‚  â”œâ”€ Voltage_Sensor_Range  
     â”‚  â””â”€ Temperature_Sensor_Accuracy  
     â””â”€ State_Machine_Logic (Child)  
     ```  
3. **Add Attributes**:  
   - Include detailed descriptions, units, min/max values, or custom fields to provide context and clarity.  

### **3.2 Linking External and Internal Requirements**  
- **Bi-Directional Traceability**:  
  1. Right-click a Simulink requirement and select *Link to*.  
  2. Choose the corresponding external requirement (e.g., from an imported Word document).  
  3. Verify links in the *Requirements Perspective* to ensure proper alignment.

## **4. Requirements Perspective in Simulink**  
### **4.1 Integrated View**  
- **Enable Perspective**:  
  - Click the *Requirements Perspective* badge in the lower-right corner or open:  
    - *Requirements Browser* (left panel): Lists all requirements.  
    - *Property Inspector* (right panel): Displays detailed information about the selected requirement.  
- **Visualize Requirements and Design**:  
  - Select a requirement to highlight linked Simulink blocks or Stateflow states (indicated by a pink highlight).  

### **4.2 Navigation**  
- **Jump to Source**: Right-click a requirement and select *Show Document* to view its origin (e.g., a specific section in a Word document).  
- **Expand/Collapse**: Organize requirements hierarchically for better readability and management.  

---

## **5. Linking Requirements to Design Elements**  
### **5.1 Drag-and-Drop Linking**  
1. **Link Blocks/States**:  
   - Drag a requirement from the *Requirements Browser* onto a Simulink block or Stateflow state.  
   - A link icon (ðŸ“Ž) appears on the block or state, indicating a successful link.  
2. **Verify Links**:  
   - Select a block or state, and the *Property Inspector* will display the linked requirements.  

### **5.2 Stateflow Integration**  
- **Link States/Transitions**:  
  - Example: Link a requirement like *"Fault Mode Activation"* to a Stateflow fault state.  
  - Use *Highlight Dependencies* in the toolstrip to visualize all linked elements.  

### **5.3 Consistency Checks**  
- **Validate Properties**:  
  - Ensure block parameters (e.g., input ranges, units) match the requirement specifications.  
  - Use Simulink Checkâ„¢ to enforce modeling standards and identify inconsistencies.

## **6. Tracking Implementation Progress**  
### **6.1 Status Monitoring**  
- **Implementation Status Column**:  
  - Right-click in the *Requirements Browser* and select *Add Column > Implementation Status*.  
  - Track progress with status indicators:  
    - **Implemented**: Linked to design elements.  
    - **Not Implemented**: Missing links or pending validation.  
- **Example**:  
  ```plaintext  
  Chapter 4.3 (State Machine Logic) â†’ 60% Complete  
  Input_Interfaces â†’ 100% Implemented  
  ```  

### **6.2 Reporting**  
- **Generate Traceability Matrix**:  
  - Automatically map requirements to design elements for audits or certifications (e.g., ISO 26262).  
  - Use the traceability matrix to ensure all requirements are addressed and validated.

## **7. Key Benefits**  
1. **Risk Mitigation**: Early detection of gaps between requirements and design, reducing the likelihood of project failures.  
2. **Efficiency**: Centralized management of requirements and design in one environment, streamlining the development process.  
3. **Compliance**: Simplified workflows for meeting standards such as ISO 26262 or DO-178C, ensuring certification readiness.  
4. **Collaboration**: Synchronize changes across teams using external and internal tools, improving collaboration and consistency.
