# Unit Testing

## **1. Introduction to Unit Testing**

Unit testing is an essential phase in the development lifecycle of a Battery Management System (BMS). It involves validating individual components—such as the state machine, balancing logic, or SOC estimation modules—to ensure they function correctly and meet specified requirements. By isolating each unit, developers can identify and rectify defects early, enhancing the overall reliability and performance of the BMS. The key objectives of unit testing include:

- **Isolate Components**: Test specific logic without external dependencies to ensure accurate and independent results.
  
- **Inject Test Inputs**: Simulate real-world scenarios (e.g., voltage spikes, temperature faults) to evaluate component behavior under various conditions.
  
- **Verify Outputs**: Validate component responses against expected behaviors to confirm compliance with design requirements.

Effective unit testing not only ensures that each component operates as intended but also facilitates smoother integration and system-level testing by providing a solid foundation of verified building blocks.

     - **Fault Condition**: Inject a `cell_voltage = 6V` to simulate an over-voltage fault.
   
   **Signal Builder Configuration Example**:
   
   ```matlab
   % MATLAB Code Snippet: Creating a Fault Condition in Signal Builder
   % Access the Signal Builder block
   signalBuilder = 'StateMachine_Test/Input_Signal';
   
   % Define a new signal set for fault condition
   open_system(signalBuilder);
   add_state(signalBuilder, 'Fault_Voltage');
   
   % Define the waveform
   set_param([signalBuilder '/Fault_Voltage'], 'Time', '[0 1]', 'Value', '[5 6]');
   
   % Save and close
   save_system(signalBuilder);
   close_system(signalBuilder);
   ```
