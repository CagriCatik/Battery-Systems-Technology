# Measuring and Improving Test Coverage

## **1. Introduction to Model Coverage**  
Model coverage quantifies how thoroughly your test cases exercise Simulink blocks, Stateflow states/transitions, and logic pathways. Key metrics include:  
- **Decision Coverage**: Tests all Boolean outcomes (e.g., `if` conditions).  
- **Condition Coverage**: Validates individual sub-expressions in logical conditions.  
- **Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MCDC)**: Ensures each condition independently affects the decision outcome.

## **2. Enabling and Analyzing Coverage**  
### **2.1 Configuring Coverage Metrics**  
1. **Enable Coverage in Test Manager**:  
   - Open the test file in **Simulink Test Manager**.  
   - Navigate to *Coverage Settings* and enable metrics:  
     - Decision, Condition, MCDC.  
   - Run the test suite to collect coverage data.  

### **2.2 Interpreting Results**  
- **Coverage Summary**:  
  - View aggregate metrics (e.g., `73% MCDC`).  
  - Drill into individual tests to see per-iteration coverage.  
- **Model Highlighting**:  
  - **Green**: Fully covered elements.  
  - **Red**: Partially or not covered elements.  
  - Example: A Stateflow transition with untested `Fault_Present` condition.  

### **2.3 Coverage Reports**  
- **Generate HTML/PDF Reports**:  
  - Click *Generate Report* in Test Manager.  
  - Includes coverage percentages, untested paths, and design errors.

## **3. Automatically Generating Tests to Improve Coverage**  
### **3.1 Using Simulink Design Verifier**  
1. **Identify Coverage Gaps**:  
   - Analyze red-highlighted elements in the model (e.g., untested transitions).  
2. **Activate Test Generator**:  
   - Click *Generate Tests* in the Test Manager.  
   - Specify coverage goals (e.g., 100% MCDC).  
3. **Generate Targeted Tests**:  
   - Simulink Design Verifier creates new test iterations to cover missing paths.  
   - Example: Adds 13 iterations to test `Fault_Present` conditions.  

### **3.2 Combining Manual and Automated Tests**  
- **Initial Coverage**: 73% MCDC.  
- **After Auto-Generated Tests**: 87% MCDC.  
- **Result**: Hybrid test suites (manual + automated) maximize coverage efficiency.

## **4. Addressing Coverage Limitations**  
### **4.1 Common Causes of Incomplete Coverage**  
1. **Missing Tests**: Untested logic pathways (e.g., edge cases).  
2. **Dead Logic**: Unreachable code or redundant conditions.  
3. **Design Errors**: Integer overflow, division by zero, or out-of-bounds array access.  

### **4.2 Detecting Design Errors**  
- **Static Analysis with Simulink Design Verifier**:  
  - Identifies runtime errors without simulation:  
    - **Range Violations**: Signals exceeding min/max limits.  
    - **Dead Logic**: Unused states/transitions.  
    - **Arithmetic Errors**: Division by zero, overflow.  
  - Results highlighted in **green** (valid) or **red** (violations).

## **5. Case Study: Improving Coverage**  
### **5.1 Initial Setup**  
- **Test Suite**: Manual tests achieving 73% MCDC.  
- **Uncovered Element**: `Fault_Present` transition in Stateflow.  

### **5.2 Automated Test Generation**  
- **New Tests**: 13 iterations targeting uncovered paths.  
- **Coverage After Automation**: 87% MCDC.  

### **5.3 Debugging Remaining Gaps**  
- **Root Cause**: Dead logic in a transition condition.  
- **Solution**: Refactor design or add explicit test cases.

## **6. Key Tools and Workflow**  
### **6.1 Simulink Coverage**  
- **Metrics**: Decision, Condition, MCDC.  
- **Visualization**: Color-coded model highlighting.  
- **Reporting**: Certification-ready HTML/PDF.  

### **6.2 Simulink Design Verifier**  
- **Test Generation**: Fills coverage gaps with targeted cases.  
- **Static Analysis**: Detects design errors pre-deployment.

## **7. Benefits**  
- **Risk Reduction**: Achieve 100% coverage for safety-critical systems (e.g., ISO 26262 ASIL-D).  
- **Efficiency**: Automate repetitive test creation.  
- **Certification**: Generate evidence for standards like IEC 61508 or DO-178C.

## **Summary**  
Improving BMS test coverage involves:  
1. Enabling **model coverage metrics** (MCDC, Decision) in Simulink Test Manager.  
2. Generating **automated tests** to target uncovered paths.  
3. Using **static analysis** to detect dead logic and runtime errors.  
4. Combining manual and automated tests for hybrid coverage.
