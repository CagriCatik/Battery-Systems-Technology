' Define main modules as components
component "Battery Pack" as A
component "Cell Monitoring Module" as B
component "Balancing Module" as C
component "Control Module" as D
component "Communication Module" as E
component "Power Distribution Module" as F

' Define subcomponents in packages
package "Cell Monitoring Sensors" {
    [Voltage Sensor] as B1
    [Temperature Sensor] as B2
    [Current Sensor] as B3

' Define relationships between main modules
A --> B : Provides voltage/current
A --> C : Supplies power for balancing

' Connect subcomponents to their parent modules
B --> B1
B --> B2
B --> B3

C --> C1
C --> C2

D --> D1
D --> D2

E --> E1
E --> E2
E --> E3

' Inter-module interactions
B --> D : Sends sensor data
C --> D : Provides balancing status
D --> C : Issues balancing commands
D --> F : Triggers power control signals
D --> E : Transmits status & logs
F --> D : Feedback voltage/current

' Additional diagnostic feedback loop
D2 --> B : Diagnostic requests
