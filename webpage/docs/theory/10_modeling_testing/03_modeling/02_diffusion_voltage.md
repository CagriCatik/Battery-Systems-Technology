# Diffusion Voltage in Batteries

## Introduction

Diffusion voltage is a critical phenomenon observed in batteries, particularly in lithium-ion batteries. It refers to the delay in the battery's voltage returning to its original state after a current has been drawn or applied. This delay is analogous to the behavior of a capacitor in an electrical circuit, where the voltage does not instantaneously return to its initial value after a change in current. Understanding diffusion voltage is essential for accurately modeling battery behavior, especially in applications like electric vehicles, portable electronics, and renewable energy storage systems.

## Understanding Diffusion Voltage

### Conceptual Explanation

To understand diffusion voltage, consider the following analogy:

1. **Rubber Sheet Analogy**: Imagine a rubber sheet stretched over a frame. If you place a heavy ball on the sheet, it will bend and deform. When you remove the ball, the rubber sheet does not immediately return to its original flat state. Instead, it slowly relaxes back to its initial position over time. This delay in returning to the original state is similar to the diffusion voltage phenomenon in batteries.

2. **Battery Context**: In a battery, when a current is drawn (discharge) or applied (charge), the voltage changes due to internal resistance and other factors. When the current is stopped, the voltage does not instantly return to its open-circuit voltage (OCV). Instead, it gradually relaxes back to the OCV over time. This delay is caused by the diffusion of ions within the battery's electrolyte and electrodes.

## Mathematical Representation

### Linear Polarization

Before diving into diffusion voltage, it is important to understand **linear polarization**, which is closely related. Linear polarization refers to the immediate voltage drop or rise observed when a current is applied to a battery. This effect is primarily due to the internal resistance of the battery.

The mathematical representation of linear polarization is given by:

$$
V_{\text{terminal}} = V_{\text{OCV}} \pm I \cdot R_{\text{internal}}
$$

Where:
- $ V_{\text{terminal}} $: Terminal voltage of the battery.
- $ V_{\text{OCV}} $: Open-circuit voltage of the battery.
- $ I $: Current flowing through the battery (positive for discharge, negative for charge).
- $ R_{\text{internal}} $: Internal resistance of the battery.

This equation captures the immediate voltage change due to the internal resistance of the battery.

### Diffusion Voltage

Diffusion voltage, on the other hand, accounts for the delayed response of the battery voltage after the current is removed. This phenomenon can be modeled using a combination of resistors and capacitors in an equivalent circuit model.

#### Equivalent Circuit Model

To model diffusion voltage, we use an RC (resistor-capacitor) circuit in parallel, connected in series with the battery's internal resistance. The RC circuit represents the diffusion process, where:
- The resistor ($ R_{\text{diff}} $) represents the resistance to ion diffusion.
- The capacitor ($ C_{\text{diff}} $) represents the storage and release of energy due to ion diffusion.

The equivalent circuit for a lithium-ion battery with diffusion voltage can be represented as:

$$
V_{\text{terminal}} = V_{\text{OCV}} \pm I \cdot R_{\text{internal}} - V_{\text{diff}}
$$

Where $ V_{\text{diff}} $ is the voltage across the RC circuit, which accounts for the diffusion effect.

#### Mathematical Equation for Diffusion Voltage

The voltage across the RC circuit ($ V_{\text{diff}} $) can be described by the following differential equation:

$$
\frac{dV_{\text{diff}}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{R_{\text{diff}} \cdot C_{\text{diff}}} \cdot V_{\text{diff}} + \frac{I}{C_{\text{diff}}}
$$

Where:
- $ V_{\text{diff}} $: Voltage across the RC circuit.
- $ R_{\text{diff}} $: Diffusion resistance.
- $ C_{\text{diff}} $: Diffusion capacitance.
- $ I $: Current flowing through the battery.

This equation describes how the diffusion voltage changes over time in response to the applied current.

## Practical Implications

### Observing Diffusion Voltage

In practical scenarios, diffusion voltage can be observed in the following ways:
1. **Voltage Relaxation**: After disconnecting a load or charger, the battery voltage does not immediately return to its OCV. Instead, it slowly relaxes over time.
2. **State of Charge (SOC) Estimation**: Diffusion voltage affects the accuracy of SOC estimation. Ignoring this phenomenon can lead to errors in predicting the remaining battery capacity.
3. **Battery Management Systems (BMS)**: Advanced BMS algorithms incorporate diffusion voltage models to improve the accuracy of voltage and SOC predictions.

## Simulation and Modeling

To better understand diffusion voltage, it is often simulated using software tools like MATLAB. The following steps outline a basic simulation approach:
1. **Define Battery Parameters**: Specify the internal resistance, diffusion resistance, and diffusion capacitance.
2. **Apply Current Profile**: Simulate charge and discharge cycles by applying a current profile.
3. **Observe Voltage Response**: Analyze the terminal voltage response, paying attention to the delayed relaxation due to diffusion voltage.

## Conclusion

Diffusion voltage is a fundamental phenomenon in battery behavior that accounts for the delayed response of voltage after current changes. By modeling this effect using equivalent RC circuits and differential equations, we can accurately predict battery performance and improve the design of battery management systems. Understanding diffusion voltage is crucial for optimizing battery usage in various applications, from consumer electronics to electric vehicles.
