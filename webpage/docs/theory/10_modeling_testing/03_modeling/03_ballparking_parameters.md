# Ballparking Parameters for Diffusion Voltage in Batteries

In this section, we will break down the components of the diffusion voltage graph and explain how each parameter contributes to the observed behavior. This will help in understanding the role of each component in the battery's equivalent circuit model and how they influence the voltage response during charge and discharge cycles.

## Components of the Diffusion Voltage Graph

The graph of diffusion voltage typically shows the following key features:
1. **Initial Voltage Drop**: The immediate drop in voltage when a current is applied.
2. **Curve Shape**: The gradual change in voltage over time after the initial drop.
3. **Relaxation Time**: The time taken for the voltage to return to its initial state after the current is removed.

Each of these features is influenced by specific components in the battery's equivalent circuit model.

### 1. **Initial Voltage Drop**

The initial voltage drop is primarily caused by the **internal resistance ($ R_{\text{internal}} $)** of the battery. When a current ($ I $) is drawn from the battery, the voltage drops instantaneously due to Ohm's Law:

$$
\Delta V_{\text{initial}} = I \cdot R_{\text{internal}}
$$

Where:
- $ \Delta V_{\text{initial}} $: The initial voltage drop.
- $ I $: The current drawn from the battery.
- $ R_{\text{internal}} $: The internal resistance of the battery.

This drop is linear and directly proportional to the current. The higher the current, the greater the voltage drop.

### 2. **Curve Shape (Diffusion Effect)**

The shape of the curve after the initial drop is influenced by the **diffusion resistance ($ R_{\text{diff}} $)** and **diffusion capacitance ($ C_{\text{diff}} $)**. These components model the delayed response of the battery voltage due to the diffusion of ions within the electrolyte and electrodes.

The voltage change due to diffusion is described by the following equation:

$$
V_{\text{diff}}(t) = V_{\text{diff, initial}} \cdot e^{-\frac{t}{\tau}}
$$

Where:
- $ V_{\text{diff}}(t) $: The diffusion voltage at time $ t $.
- $ V_{\text{diff, initial}} $: The initial diffusion voltage.
- $ \tau $: The time constant of the RC circuit, given by $ \tau = R_{\text{diff}} \cdot C_{\text{diff}} $.

The time constant ($ \tau $) determines how quickly the voltage relaxes back to its initial state. A larger $ \tau $ means a slower relaxation, while a smaller $ \tau $ means a faster relaxation.

### 3. **Relaxation Time**

The relaxation time is the time taken for the voltage to return to its initial state after the current is removed. This is determined by the **time constant ($ \tau $)** of the RC circuit:

$$
\tau = R_{\text{diff}} \cdot C_{\text{diff}}
$$

The number of RC branches in the equivalent circuit model depends on the battery chemistry:
- **LFP (Lithium Iron Phosphate)**: Typically has 4 RC branches.
- **NMC (Lithium Nickel Manganese Cobalt Oxide)**: Typically has 3 RC branches.
- **LTO (Lithium Titanate)**: Typically has 1 RC branch.

The total relaxation time is influenced by the number of RC branches and their respective time constants.

## Mathematical Representation

The overall terminal voltage of the battery can be expressed as:

$$
V_{\text{terminal}} = V_{\text{OCV}} - I \cdot R_{\text{internal}} - \sum_{i=1}^{n} V_{\text{diff, i}}
$$

Where:
- $ V_{\text{OCV}} $: Open-circuit voltage of the battery.
- $ I \cdot R_{\text{internal}} $: Voltage drop due to internal resistance.
- $ \sum_{i=1}^{n} V_{\text{diff, i}} $: Sum of diffusion voltages across all RC branches.

Each diffusion voltage ($ V_{\text{diff, i}} $) is governed by the differential equation:

$$
\frac{dV_{\text{diff, i}}}{dt} = -\frac{1}{R_{\text{diff, i}} \cdot C_{\text{diff, i}}} \cdot V_{\text{diff, i}} + \frac{I}{C_{\text{diff, i}}}
$$

## Practical Interpretation

### Key Parameters and Their Roles
1. **Internal Resistance ($ R_{\text{internal}} $)**: Causes the immediate voltage drop when current is applied.
2. **Diffusion Resistance ($ R_{\text{diff}} $)**: Determines the magnitude of the diffusion effect.
3. **Diffusion Capacitance ($ C_{\text{diff}} $)**: Determines the time scale of the diffusion effect.
4. **Time Constant ($ \tau $)**: Defines how quickly the voltage relaxes back to its initial state.

### Example for Different Chemistries
- **LFP Battery**: 
  - 4 RC branches.
  - Longer relaxation time due to multiple time constants.
- **NMC Battery**: 
  - 3 RC branches.
  - Moderate relaxation time.
- **LTO Battery**: 
  - 1 RC branch.
  - Shorter relaxation time.

## Summary

The diffusion voltage graph is influenced by three main components:
1. **Internal Resistance**: Causes the initial voltage drop.
2. **Diffusion Resistance and Capacitance**: Define the shape of the curve and the relaxation time.
3. **Number of RC Branches**: Depends on the battery chemistry and affects the overall relaxation behavior.

By understanding these parameters, we can accurately model and predict the behavior of batteries under different operating conditions. This knowledge is essential for designing efficient battery management systems and optimizing battery performance in various applications.
