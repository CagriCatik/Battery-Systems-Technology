# Measuring and Improving Test Coverage

## **1. Introduction to Model Coverage**

Model coverage is a critical metric in the validation and verification process of Battery Management Systems (BMS). It quantifies the extent to which your test cases exercise the various components of your Simulink model, including Simulink blocks, Stateflow states/transitions, and logical pathways. Achieving high model coverage ensures that the system behaves as expected under a wide range of scenarios, thereby enhancing reliability and safetyâ€”key aspects for BMS in applications such as electric vehicles and energy storage systems.

### **Key Coverage Metrics**

1. **Decision Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that every possible outcome of each Boolean decision (e.g., `if` conditions) is tested at least once.
   - **Importance**: Verifies that all branches of conditional statements are executed, preventing untested paths that could harbor defects.
   - **Example**: Testing both the true and false outcomes of an `if (temperature > threshold)` condition.

2. **Condition Coverage**:
   - **Definition**: Validates that each individual sub-expression within a complex Boolean condition is tested for all possible outcomes.
   - **Importance**: Ensures that every condition within a decision statement is independently evaluated, enhancing the thoroughness of tests.
   - **Example**: For a condition like `if (voltage > V_min && voltage < V_max)`, both `voltage > V_min` and `voltage < V_max` are individually tested.

3. **Modified Condition/Decision Coverage (MCDC)**:
   - **Definition**: Ensures that each condition within a decision statement independently affects the outcome of the decision.
   - **Importance**: Critical for safety-critical systems (e.g., ISO 26262 ASIL-D) as it verifies the influence of each condition on the overall decision logic.
   - **Example**: In `if (A && B)`, altering the value of `A` while keeping `B` constant changes the outcome, and vice versa.

Achieving comprehensive model coverage not only enhances the reliability of the BMS but also facilitates compliance with stringent safety standards, ensuring that the system is robust against a variety of operational scenarios and potential fault conditions.

   % MATLAB Code Snippet: Refactoring to Address Dead Logic
   % Locate the dead Stateflow state
   deadState = sfroot.find('-isa', 'Stateflow.State', '-and', 'Name', 'Maintenance_Mode');
   
   if ~isempty(deadState)
       % Remove the dead state from the chart
       chart = deadState.Chart;
       remove(deadState);
       disp('Dead logic removed: Maintenance_Mode state deleted.');
   else
       disp('No dead logic found in the model.');
   end
   ```

- **Uncovered Element**: The `Fault_Present` transition within a Stateflow chart remains untested, representing a critical coverage gap.

**Initial Coverage Overview**:
```plaintext
Coverage Summary:
- Decision Coverage: 90%
- Condition Coverage: 85%
- MCDC Coverage: 73%
- Uncovered Transition: Fault_Present in Stateflow
```

### **5.2 Automated Test Generation**

To address the uncovered `Fault_Present` transition, Simulink Design Verifier is utilized to generate additional test cases aimed at achieving full coverage.

% Run Simulink Design Verifier to generate tests
generatedTests = Simulink.DesignVerifier.generateTestCases(model, ...
    'CoverageGoal', coverageGoal, 'Target', 'Fault_Present');

% Add generated tests to the test suite
Simulink.Test.TestManager.addTestCases(testSuite, generatedTests);

disp('Automated test cases generated for Fault_Present transition.');
```
*Figure 11: MATLAB Code for Automated Test Generation*

**Post-Automation Coverage Overview**:
```plaintext
Coverage Summary After Automation:
- Decision Coverage: 95%
- Condition Coverage: 90%
- MCDC Coverage: 87%
```

### **5.3 Debugging Remaining Gaps**

Despite the automated test generation, a residual coverage gap remains due to dead logic within the model.

#### **Root Cause Analysis**

- **Issue**: The `Fault_Present` transition is linked to a condition that, due to a design flaw, can never be true. This results in dead logic that cannot be exercised through testing.

#### **Solution**

   - **Action**: Modify the condition associated with the `Fault_Present` transition to ensure it can be reached during simulations.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Example**: Adjust the logical conditions to remove redundancies or contradictions that prevent the transition from being activated.

2. **Re-run Coverage Analysis**:
   - **Action**: After refactoring, run the coverage analysis again to confirm that the dead logic has been eliminated and that coverage metrics have improved.
   
   **Refactoring Example**:
   ```matlab
   % MATLAB Code Snippet: Refactoring Fault_Present Condition
   % Locate the Fault_Present transition in Stateflow
   faultTransition = sfroot.find('-isa', 'Stateflow.Transition', '-and', 'Name', 'Fault_Present');
   
   if ~isempty(faultTransition)
       % Modify the condition to ensure it can be triggered
       faultTransition.Condition = 'temperature > fault_temperature_threshold';
       disp('Fault_Present transition condition refactored to allow activation.');
   else
       disp('Fault_Present transition not found.');
   end
   ```

   *Figure 12: MATLAB Code for Refactoring Fault_Present Condition*

**Final Coverage Overview**:
```plaintext
Final Coverage Summary:
- Decision Coverage: 100%
- Condition Coverage: 100%
- MCDC Coverage: 100%
```

**Outcome**: The BMS model achieves **100% MCDC coverage**, ensuring that all logical pathways, including previously dead logic, are thoroughly tested and validated.

   - Use visual model highlighting to quickly pinpoint uncovered elements.

3. **Automate Test Generation**:
   - Employ **Simulink Design Verifier** to automatically generate targeted test cases that address uncovered paths.
   - Integrate these automated tests into existing test suites to enhance coverage without manual effort.

4. **Address Coverage Limitations**:
   - Identify and eliminate **dead logic** and **design errors** through static analysis.
   - Refactor the model to ensure all logical pathways are executable and testable.

5. **Iterate and Optimize**:
   - Continuously run coverage analyses, generate new tests, and refine the model to achieve and maintain high coverage levels.
   - Ensure that all requirements are traceably linked to corresponding test cases and coverage metrics.

6. **Generate and Utilize Coverage Reports**:
   - Create detailed coverage reports to document test effectiveness and support certification processes.
   - Use these reports to communicate test results and coverage status to stakeholders and auditors.
