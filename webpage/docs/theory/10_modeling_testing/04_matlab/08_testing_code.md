# Testing Generated Code

## **Introduction to Code Validation**

After generating code from a BMS model in Simulink, it is imperative to validate the generated code to ensure that it faithfully replicates the behavior of the original model. Code validation serves as a bridge between model-based design and its implementation in embedded systems, guaranteeing that the transition maintains the system's integrity, performance, and compliance with safety standards. Two fundamental methods employed in code validation are:

- **Software-in-the-Loop (SIL)**: This method involves executing the generated code on a host computer, allowing for the validation of functional correctness by comparing the code's behavior against the Simulink model's simulation results.

- **Processor-in-the-Loop (PIL)**: PIL testing takes code validation a step further by running the generated code on the actual target embedded hardware (e.g., BeagleBone Black). This approach assesses both performance metrics and real-time behavior, ensuring that the code operates as intended in the intended hardware environment.

Implementing both SIL and PIL testing provides a comprehensive validation framework, ensuring that the BMS software is not only functionally accurate but also performant and reliable in real-world applications.

## **Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) Testing**

Software-in-the-Loop (SIL) testing is a critical phase in validating the functional correctness of the generated code. By executing the code on a host PC, developers can ensure that the software behaves identically to the Simulink model before deploying it to embedded hardware.

### **Workflow**

The SIL testing workflow involves several key steps that bridge the gap between model-based design and code validation:

1. **Generate Code**:
   - **Action**: Utilize Embedded Coder to produce `.c` and `.h` files from the validated BMS Simulink model.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Open the Simulink model.
     - Navigate to *Code > Embedded Coder*.
     - Configure code generation settings as per model requirements.
     - Click *Generate Code* to produce the source files.
   - **Outcome**: Generated code files (e.g., `BMS_StateMachine.c`, `BMS_StateMachine.h`) ready for validation.

2. **Reuse Existing Tests**:
   - **Action**: Leverage the test harnesses created during the model-based testing phase to validate the generated code.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Ensure that test harnesses are configured to interface with the generated code.
     - Import or reference the test cases within the Simulink Test Manager.
   - **Benefit**: Streamlines the testing process by reusing established test scenarios, ensuring consistency between model and code validation.

3. **Configure SIL Mode**:
   - **Action**: Set up the Simulink Test Manager to execute tests in SIL mode.
   - **Procedure**:
     - Open **Simulink Test Manager**.
     - Select the desired test suite or test case.
     - Navigate to *Simulation Mode* and choose **Software-in-the-Loop**.
     - Configure any additional SIL settings as required.
   - **Outcome**: The simulation environment replaces the Simulink model with the compiled object code during test execution, enabling direct validation of the code's functionality.

   **SIL Configuration Example**:
   
   ```matlab
   % MATLAB Code Snippet: Configuring SIL Mode in Test Manager
   testSuite = 'BMS_SIL_Test_Suite';
   Simulink.Test.TestManager.selectTestSuite(testSuite);
   
   % Set simulation mode to SIL
   Simulink.Test.TestManager.setSimulationMode(testSuite, 'SIL');
   
   disp(['Simulation mode set to SIL for test suite: ' testSuite]);
   ```
   
   *Figure 1: MATLAB Code for Configuring SIL Mode*

### **2.2 Equivalence Testing**

Equivalence testing is a method used to ensure that the behavior of the generated code (SIL) matches that of the original Simulink model (Model-in-the-Loop, MIL). This comparison is crucial for validating that the code accurately represents the model's logic and functionality.

- **Objective**: Verify that outputs from SIL tests (generated code) are identical to those from MIL tests (Simulink model simulations).

- **Steps**:
  
  1. **Run MIL Tests**:
     - **Action**: Execute the test suite in MIL mode to obtain baseline simulation results.
     - **Procedure**:
       - Open **Simulink Test Manager**.
       - Select the test suite and ensure the simulation mode is set to MIL.
       - Run the tests and log the results.
  
  2. **Run SIL Tests**:
     - **Action**: Execute the same test suite in SIL mode to obtain generated code results.
     - **Procedure**:
       - Change the simulation mode to SIL as outlined in Section 2.1.
       - Run the tests and log the results.
  
  3. **Compare Results**:
     - **Action**: Use **Simulink Test Manager** to compare MIL and SIL results for equivalence.
     - **Procedure**:
       - Navigate to the *Comparison* tool within Simulink Test Manager.
       - Select the corresponding MIL and SIL test runs.
       - Execute the comparison to identify discrepancies.
  
  - **Outcome**: A pass/fail status for each test iteration based on the equivalence of outputs between MIL and SIL.

  milResults = Simulink.Test.TestManager.runTestSuite('BMS_MIL_Test_Suite');
  silResults = Simulink.Test.TestManager.runTestSuite('BMS_SIL_Test_Suite');
  
  % Compare MIL and SIL results
  equivalence = Simulink.Test.TestManager.compareTestResults(milResults, silResults);
  
  if all(equivalence.Pass)
      disp('All SIL tests passed; code behavior matches the Simulink model.');
  else
      disp('SIL tests failed; discrepancies detected between code and model.');
  end
  ```

  Simulink.sdi.view;
  
  % Compare specific signals
  Simulink.sdi.compare('Error', milData.Error, silData.Error);
  
  % Display comparison results
  if silData.Error == milData.Error
      disp('Error signal matches between MIL and SIL.');
  else
      disp('Discrepancy detected in Error signal between MIL and SIL.');
  end
  ```

  - **Usage**:
    - Load data logs from MIL, SIL, and PIL tests into SDI.
    - Use the overlay feature to visually compare signal behaviors.
  
- **Execution Time Profiling**:
  - **Function**: Visualize task execution times to assess performance metrics and real-time compliance.
  - **Usage**:
    - Plot execution times against simulation time to identify performance bottlenecks.
  
  **Simulation Data Inspector Example**:
  
  ```matlab
  % MATLAB Code Snippet: Using Simulation Data Inspector for Signal Comparison
  % Load MIL data
  milData = sdiCollection('BMS_MIL_Data.sdi');
  
  % Load SIL data
  silData = sdiCollection('BMS_SIL_Data.sdi');
  
  % Load PIL data
  pilData = sdiCollection('BMS_PIL_Data.sdi');
  
  % Open SDI
  Simulink.sdi.view;
  
  % Compare specific signals
  Simulink.sdi.compare(milData, silData, pilData, 'Error');
  
  disp('Signal comparison completed in Simulation Data Inspector.');
  ```
