**Example Implementation**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Code Snippet: Creating a Trigger-Response Assessment
% Define the assessment parameters
trigger_condition = 'Charge_Relay_Open == true && BMS_State ~= Charging';
trigger_duration = 0.1; % seconds
expected_response = 'Negative_Contactor == Open';
response_delay = 0.05; % seconds

% Add the Trigger-Response Assessment
add_trigger_response_assessment('Charger_Contactor_Open_Validation', ...
    trigger_condition, trigger_duration, expected_response, response_delay);

disp('Trigger-Response Assessment for Charger Contactor has been created.');
```

   - **Adjust**: Modify mappings as necessary to correct any discrepancies.

**Signal Mapping Example**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Function: Mapping Assessment Variables to Simulink Signals
function mapAssessmentSignals()
    % Define the mappings
    mappings = {
        'BMS_State', 'State_Request';
        'Charge_Relay_Open', 'PreCharge_Relay';
        'Negative_Contactor', 'Neg_Contactor_State';
    };
    
    % Apply the mappings
    for i = 1:size(mappings, 1)
        add_signal_mapping('Charger_Contactor_Open_Validation', mappings{i,1}, mappings{i,2});
    end
    
    disp('Signal mappings for assessments have been established.');
end
```
