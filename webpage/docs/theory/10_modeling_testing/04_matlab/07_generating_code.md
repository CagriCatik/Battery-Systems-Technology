# Generating Code

## **1. Introduction to Code Generation**

Code generation is a pivotal step in the development lifecycle of a Battery Management System (BMS) using Simulink. By converting validated Simulink models into embedded software, developers ensure that the transition from design to implementation maintains the integrity and functionality of the system. **Embedded Coder**, a key tool within Simulink, facilitates this process by providing advanced capabilities for generating optimized, production-quality C and C++ code tailored for embedded systems.

### **Key Benefits of Code Generation**

1. **Accuracy**:
   - **Consistency**: The generated code mirrors the behavior of the Simulink model, ensuring that the implementation aligns perfectly with the design specifications.
   - **Reduced Errors**: Automated code generation minimizes manual coding errors, enhancing the reliability of the BMS software.

2. **Certification Readiness**:
   - **Compliance**: Generated code adheres to stringent safety standards such as ISO 26262 ASIL-D, making it suitable for safety-critical automotive applications.
   - **Documentation**: Embedded Coder supports the creation of comprehensive documentation required for certification processes, streamlining regulatory approvals.

3. **Traceability**:
   - **Bi-Directional Links**: Maintains clear connections between code, model elements, and system requirements, facilitating easy audits and compliance checks.
   - **Change Management**: Simplifies tracking of modifications across the design and implementation phases, ensuring that updates are consistently applied.

By leveraging Embedded Coder for code generation, developers can efficiently produce high-quality, certified software for BMS applications, ensuring both performance and compliance with industry standards.

## **2. Setting Up Code Generation**

Setting up code generation involves configuring Simulink and Embedded Coder to translate the validated BMS model into executable embedded software. This setup ensures that the generated code meets design requirements and adheres to certification standards.

### **2.1 Accessing the Code Perspective**

To initiate the code generation process, developers must access the Code Perspective within Simulink, which provides specialized tools for configuring and managing code generation settings.

1. **Open Embedded Coder**:
   - **Action**: From the Simulink model, navigate to the *Simulink Toolstrip* and click on the *Embedded Coder* badge located in the bottom-right corner.
   - **Alternative Access**: Alternatively, select *Apps > Embedded Coder* from the Simulink menu.
   - **Outcome**: This action opens the Code Perspective, presenting tools and interfaces dedicated to code generation.

   ![Accessing Code Perspective](#)

   *Figure 1: Accessing the Code Perspective in Simulink*

2. **Key Tools**:
   - **Code Mappings Editor**:
     - **Function**: Define storage classes for model elements such as inputs, outputs, and parameters. Storage classes determine how variables are declared and managed in the generated code.
     - **Usage**: Assign specific storage classes to control data handling, memory usage, and interfacing with other software components.
     
   - **Model Data Editor**:
     - **Function**: Customize data types, dimensions, and storage for individual signals and parameters within the model.
     - **Usage**: Optimize memory usage and ensure compatibility with target hardware by specifying appropriate data representations.

   **Code Mappings Editor Example**:
   
   ```matlab
   % MATLAB Code Snippet: Configuring Storage Classes
   % Define storage classes for model elements
   Simulink.Requirements.setModelStorageClass('BMS_State', 'ExportedGlobal');
   Simulink.Requirements.setModelStorageClass('Cell_Voltage', 'Volatile');
   
   % Display configuration
   disp('Storage classes configured for BMS_State and Cell_Voltage.');
   ```
   
   *Figure 2: MATLAB Code for Configuring Storage Classes*

   **Model Data Editor Example**:
   
   ```matlab
   % MATLAB Code Snippet: Configuring Data Types and Storage
   % Set data type for Cell_Voltage
   set_param('BMS_Model/Cell_Voltage', 'OutDataTypeStr', 'single');
   
   % Define storage class for SOC_Estimation
   Simulink.Requirements.setModelStorageClass('SOC_Estimation', 'NonReentrant');
   
   % Display configuration
   disp('Data types and storage classes configured for Cell_Voltage and SOC_Estimation.');
   ```
   
   *Figure 3: MATLAB Code for Configuring Data Types and Storage*

### **2.2 Configuring Code Mappings**

Proper configuration of code mappings is essential to control how model elements are translated into code. This configuration influences the structure, readability, and performance of the generated software.

- **Storage Classes**: Determine the linkage and memory management of variables in the generated code. Common storage classes include:
  
  | **Model Element** | **Storage Class**   | **Code Declaration**                      |
  |-------------------|---------------------|--------------------------------------------|
  | `BMS_State`       | `ExportedGlobal`    | `extern uint8_T BMS_State;`                |
  | `Cell_Voltage`    | `Volatile`          | `volatile float Cell_Voltage;`             |
  
  **Example Configuration**:
  
  ```matlab
  % MATLAB Code Snippet: Setting Storage Classes
  % Assign ExportedGlobal to BMS_State
  set_param('BMS_Model/BMS_State', 'StorageClass', 'ExportedGlobal');
  
  % Assign Volatile to Cell_Voltage
  set_param('BMS_Model/Cell_Voltage', 'StorageClass', 'Volatile');
  
  % Confirm configurations
  disp('Storage classes assigned to BMS_State and Cell_Voltage.');
  ```
  
  *Figure 4: MATLAB Code for Assigning Storage Classes*

- **Data Types and Dimensions**:
  - **Purpose**: Optimize data representation for target hardware and ensure efficient memory usage.
  - **Example**: Setting `Cell_Voltage` as a single-precision floating-point variable reduces memory footprint while maintaining sufficient precision for voltage measurements.
  
  **Data Type Configuration Example**:
  
  ```matlab
  % MATLAB Code Snippet: Configuring Data Types
  % Set Cell_Voltage to single precision
  set_param('BMS_Model/Cell_Voltage', 'OutDataTypeStr', 'single');
  
  % Set SOC_Estimation to double precision
  set_param('BMS_Model/SOC_Estimation', 'OutDataTypeStr', 'double');
  
  % Confirm data type settings
  disp('Data types configured for Cell_Voltage and SOC_Estimation.');
  ```
  
  *Figure 5: MATLAB Code for Configuring Data Types*

By meticulously configuring code mappings, developers can ensure that the generated code is optimized for performance, memory usage, and compliance with safety standards, thereby enhancing the overall effectiveness of the BMS software.
