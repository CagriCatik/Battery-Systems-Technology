## **3. BMS Algorithm Components**

The efficacy of a BMS is largely determined by the sophistication of its underlying algorithms. This section explores the core algorithmic components implemented within the Simulink-based BMS model.

### **3.1 Current Limiting Logic**

To safeguard the battery system, the BMS incorporates current limiting mechanisms based on voltage and temperature thresholds. This ensures that the system operates within safe electrical and thermal boundaries.

1. **Voltage-Based Threshold**:
   - **Calculation**:
     - The maximum allowable current ($ I_{max} $) is computed using the formula:
       $$
       I_{max} = \frac{V_{min} - V_{cutoff}}{R_{max}}
       $$
       - **Variables**:
         - $ V_{min} $: Minimum permissible cell voltage.
         - $ V_{cutoff} $: Cutoff voltage threshold.
         - $ R_{max} $: Maximum allowable resistance.
   - **Purpose**: Prevents over-voltage conditions during the charging process by limiting the charging current based on cell voltage measurements.
   
   **Implementation Example**:

   ```matlab
   % MATLAB Function: Voltage-Based Current Limiting
   function I_max = voltageCurrentLimit(V_min, V_cutoff, R_max)
       I_max = (V_min - V_cutoff) / R_max;
   end
   ```

2. **Temperature-Based Threshold**:
   - **Implementation**:

   temperature = -20:5:60; % Temperature range in Celsius
   current_limit = [0, 2, 5, 10, 15, 10, 5, 2, 0]; % Corresponding current limits
   
   % Create a lookup table
   temp_current_map = interp1(temperature, current_limit, 'spline');
   
   % Function to get current limit based on temperature
   function I_max_temp = tempCurrentLimit(current, temp)
       I_max_temp = interp1(temperature, current_limit, temp, 'spline', 0);
   end
   ```

### **3.2 State Machine (Stateflow)**

The BMS employs a state machine, implemented using Stateflow, to manage its operational states and respond to varying conditions dynamically. This hierarchical state machine operates concurrently in four primary states:

1. **Main Operational States**:
   - **Standby**:
     - **Description**: The system remains idle, awaiting commands to initiate charging or discharging.
     - **Transitions**: Moves to `Charging` or `Driving` states based on external inputs or system triggers.
   
   - **Driving**:
     - **Description**: Represents the battery discharging to power the vehicle.
     - **Behavior**: Monitors load demand and adjusts discharge rates accordingly.
   
   - **Charging**:
     - **Description**: The battery undergoes charging, encompassing both Constant Current (CC) and Constant Voltage (CV) phases.
     - **Behavior**: Controls the charging process to optimize efficiency and battery health.
   
   - **Fault**:
     - **Description**: The system enters this state upon detecting any fault conditions.
     - **Behavior**: Initiates protective actions such as limiting current or shutting down certain functionalities to prevent damage.

2. **Fault Monitoring**:
   - **Triggers**:
     - **Over-Current**: Excessive current flow beyond safe operational limits.
     - **Over-Voltage**: Cell voltages exceeding maximum thresholds.
     - **Over-Temperature**: Elevated temperatures threatening battery integrity.
   - **Response**:
     - **Transition to Fault State**: Upon detection of any fault, the system immediately transitions to the `Fault` state.
     - **Protective Actions**: Executes predefined safety measures like reducing current flow or isolating affected cells.

3. **Contactor Control**:
   - **Function**:
     - **Operation Sequence**: Manages the activation and deactivation of charger and inverter contactors.
     - **Purpose**: Prevents inrush currents that can occur during the initial connection or disconnection of high-power components.
   - **Implementation**:
     - **Sequential Control**: Ensures that contactors are engaged or disengaged in a specific order to maintain system stability.
     - **Safety Interlocks**: Incorporates interlocks to prevent simultaneous engagement of conflicting contactors.

**Stateflow Diagram Example**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Code Snippet: Stateflow Diagram for BMS States
% Define states: Standby, Driving, Charging, Fault
sf = Stateflow.Chart;

% Standby State
standby = Stateflow.State(sf);
standby.Name = 'Standby';
standby.Position = [100 100 60 60];

% Driving State
driving = Stateflow.State(sf);
driving.Name = 'Driving';
driving.Position = [300 100 60 60];

% Charging State
charging = Stateflow.State(sf);
charging.Name = 'Charging';
charging.Position = [300 200 60 60];

% Fault State
fault = Stateflow.State(sf);
fault.Name = 'Fault';
fault.Position = [500 150 60 60];

% Transitions
transition1 = Stateflow.Transition(standby, driving);
transition1.LabelString = 'StartDriving';

transition2 = Stateflow.Transition(standby, charging);
transition2.LabelString = 'StartCharging';

transition3 = Stateflow.Transition(driving, standby);
transition3.LabelString = 'StopDriving';

transition4 = Stateflow.Transition(charging, standby);
transition4.LabelString = 'StopCharging';

transition5 = Stateflow.Transition(standby, fault);
transition5.LabelString = 'FaultDetected';

transition6 = Stateflow.Transition(driving, fault);
transition6.LabelString = 'FaultDetected';

transition7 = Stateflow.Transition(charging, fault);
transition7.LabelString = 'FaultDetected';

## **4. SOC Estimation Methods**

Accurate estimation of the State of Charge (SOC) is pivotal for effective battery management. The BMS model incorporates multiple SOC estimation techniques, each with its advantages and limitations.

### **4.1 Coulomb Counting**

Coulomb Counting is a fundamental method for SOC estimation based on the principle of charge conservation.

- **Principle**:
  - **Integration**: SOC is estimated by integrating the current over time, starting from a known initial SOC value.
    $$
    SOC = SOC_{initial} + \frac{\int I \, dt}{Capacity}
    $$
    - **Variables**:
      - $ SOC_{initial} $: The initial State of Charge at the start of measurement.
      - $ I $: Current flowing into or out of the battery.
      - $ Capacity $: The rated capacity of the battery.

- **Advantages**:
  - **Simplicity**: Easy to implement with minimal computational resources.
  - **Cost-Effective**: Requires only current measurement sensors, reducing overall system complexity.

- **Disadvantages**:
  - **Accumulation of Errors**: Sensor inaccuracies and integration errors can accumulate over time, leading to significant SOC estimation drift.
  - **Lack of Feedback Mechanism**: Does not inherently correct for discrepancies between estimated and actual SOC, especially in the absence of external references.

**Implementation Example**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Function: Coulomb Counting SOC Estimation
function SOC = coulombCounting(I, dt, SOC_initial, Capacity)
    SOC = SOC_initial + (I * dt) / Capacity;
end
```

### **4.2 Kalman Filters**

To overcome the limitations of Coulomb Counting, the BMS model integrates advanced estimation techniques using Kalman Filters, enhancing SOC accuracy through predictive modeling and measurement updates.

1. **Extended Kalman Filter (EKF)**:
   - **Method**:
     - **Linearization**: Approximates the non-linear cell model by linearizing it around the current estimate, facilitating state prediction and correction.
     - **State Prediction**: Uses the battery model to predict the next state based on current inputs.
     - **Measurement Update**: Incorporates actual voltage measurements to correct the predicted SOC.
   - **Use Case**: Effective for systems with mild non-linearities, such as the SOC vs. Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) relationship.

2. **Unscented Kalman Filter (UKF)**:
   - **Method**:
     - **Non-Linear Handling**: Utilizes the Unscented Transform to capture the mean and covariance estimates more accurately without explicit linearization.
     - **Sigma Points**: Generates a set of sample points (sigma points) to represent the probability distribution, improving estimation accuracy in highly non-linear systems.
   - **Use Case**: Preferred for systems with significant non-linearities, offering superior accuracy compared to EKF at the expense of higher computational demands.

- **Common Features**:
  - **Feedback Incorporation**: Both EKF and UKF leverage cell terminal voltage measurements to refine SOC predictions, enabling real-time adjustments and error corrections.
  - **Performance**: Demonstrates enhanced resilience against initial SOC estimation errors, rapidly converging to accurate SOC values even in the presence of significant initial discrepancies.

**EKF Implementation Example**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Function: Extended Kalman Filter for SOC Estimation
function [SOC, P] = extendedKalmanFilter(SOC_prev, P_prev, I, V_meas, dt, Capacity, R, C, V_oc_func)
    % Predict Step
    SOC_pred = SOC_prev + (I * dt) / Capacity;
    P_pred = P_prev + dt; % Process noise covariance
    
    % Measurement Update
    V_pred = V_oc_func(SOC_pred) - I * R;
    K = P_pred / (P_pred + 0.01); % Kalman Gain
    SOC = SOC_pred + K * (V_meas - V_pred);
    P = (1 - K) * P_pred;
end
```

**UKF Implementation Example**:

```matlab
% MATLAB Function: Unscented Kalman Filter for SOC Estimation
function [SOC, P] = unscentedKalmanFilter(SOC_prev, P_prev, I, V_meas, dt, Capacity, R, C, V_oc_func)
    % Define sigma points
    alpha = 1e-3;
    kappa = 0;
    beta = 2;
    n = 1; % Number of states
    lambda = alpha^2 * (n + kappa) - n;
    sigma_points = [SOC_prev; SOC_prev + sqrt((lambda + n) * P_prev)];
    
    % Predict sigma points
    sigma_pred = sigma_points + (I * dt) / Capacity;
    
    % Predict mean and covariance
    SOC_pred = sum(sigma_pred) / 2;
    P_pred = sum((sigma_pred - SOC_pred).^2) / 2 + 0.01;
    
    % Measurement prediction
    V_pred = V_oc_func(SOC_pred) - I * R;
    
    % Kalman Gain
    K = P_pred / (P_pred + 0.01);
    
    % Update state
    SOC = SOC_pred + K * (V_meas - V_pred);
    P = (1 - K) * P_pred;
end
```
