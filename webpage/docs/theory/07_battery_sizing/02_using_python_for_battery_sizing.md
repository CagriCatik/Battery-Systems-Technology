# Using Python for Battery Sizing

Battery sizing is a critical process in the design and deployment of energy storage systems, particularly for applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. Proper battery sizing ensures that the system meets the desired energy and power requirements while maintaining efficiency, safety, and longevity. Traditionally, tools like Microsoft Excel have been employed for battery sizing due to their flexibility and computational capabilities. However, with the advent of programming languages like Python, more sophisticated and scalable solutions are now possible.

This documentation provides a detailed guide on battery sizing, drawing insights from industry practices as outlined in the provided transcript. It covers the fundamental concepts, step-by-step methodologies, and offers a Python implementation to automate and enhance the battery sizing process. Whether you are a beginner seeking to understand the basics or an advanced user aiming to optimize battery configurations, this guide serves as a comprehensive resource.

## Understanding Battery Sizing

Battery sizing involves determining the appropriate number of battery cells and their arrangement to meet specific energy and power requirements. The key objectives include:

- **Meeting Energy Requirements**: Ensuring the battery system can store and deliver the required amount of energy (measured in kilowatt-hours, kWh).
- **Achieving Desired Voltage**: Configuring the system to operate at the specified voltage, which is crucial for compatibility with other system components.
- **Optimizing Capacity**: Balancing the depth of discharge (DoD) to maximize battery life while providing sufficient usable capacity.
- **Ensuring Safety and Reliability**: Maintaining voltages and currents within safe operating limits to prevent overcharging, overheating, and other potential hazards.

## Key Concepts and Terminology

Before diving into the battery sizing process, it's essential to familiarize yourself with some fundamental concepts:

- **Nominal Voltage**: The standard voltage at which a single battery cell operates (e.g., 3.6V).
- **Usable Capacity**: The effective capacity of a battery cell, considering factors like depth of discharge (DoD) and buffer percentages (e.g., 14.4Ah).
- **Series Connection**: Connecting battery cells end-to-end to increase the total voltage while maintaining the same capacity.
- **Parallel Connection**: Connecting battery cells side-by-side to increase the total capacity while maintaining the same voltage.
- **Depth of Discharge (DoD)**: The percentage of the battery's capacity that has been used. For instance, an 80% DoD implies that 80% of the battery's capacity is utilized, preserving the remaining 20% for longevity.
- **Buffer Percentage**: A safety margin incorporated into the battery's usable capacity to prevent complete discharge, thereby extending battery life.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Battery Sizing

### 1. Define Battery Cell Characteristics

The first step in battery sizing is to define the characteristics of the individual battery cells that will compose the overall battery system. This includes:

- **Nominal Voltage (`V_nominal`)**: The voltage of a single cell.
- **Usable Capacity (`C_usable`)**: The effective capacity of a single cell after accounting for the buffer percentage.

**Example:**

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class BatteryCell:
    nominal_voltage: float  # Voltage per cell in volts (V)
    usable_capacity: float  # Usable capacity per cell in ampere-hours (Ah)
```

### 2. Set Design Parameters

Design parameters define the requirements that the battery system must fulfill. These include:

- **Desired Energy (`E_desired`)**: The total energy required from the battery system, measured in kilowatt-hours (kWh).
- **System Voltage (`V_system`)**: The voltage at which the battery system should operate.
- **Buffer Percentage (`Buffer %`)**: The safety margin to prevent complete discharge, typically expressed as a percentage.

**Example:**

```python
@dataclass
class BatteryDesignParameters:
    desired_energy_kwh: float     # Desired energy in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
    system_voltage: float         # Desired system voltage in volts (V)
    buffer_percentage: float      # Depth of discharge (e.g., 80 for 80%)
```

### 3. Calculate Required Configuration

With the cell characteristics and design parameters defined, the next step is to determine the number of series and parallel connections required to meet the desired energy and voltage specifications.

#### a. Adjust for Buffer Percentage

The usable capacity of each cell is adjusted based on the buffer percentage to ensure that the battery is not fully discharged, which enhances its lifespan.

```python
usable_capacity = cell.usable_capacity * (design.buffer_percentage / 100)
```

#### b. Calculate Total Ampere-Hours Needed

The total ampere-hours (Ah) required from the battery system is calculated by converting the desired energy from kilowatt-hours to watt-hours and then dividing by the system voltage.

```python
total_ah_needed = (design.desired_energy_kwh * 1000) / design.system_voltage
```

#### c. Determine Number of Series Cells

The number of cells connected in series is determined by dividing the desired system voltage by the nominal voltage of a single cell. Since the number of cells must be an integer, the result is rounded up using the ceiling function.

```python
from math import ceil

num_series = ceil(design.system_voltage / cell.nominal_voltage)
```

**Example:**
For a system voltage of 650V and a cell nominal voltage of 3.6V:
```
num_series = ceil(650 / 3.6) = 181 cells in series
```

#### d. Recalculate Actual System Voltage

The actual system voltage is recalculated based on the integer number of series cells.

```python
actual_system_voltage = num_series * cell.nominal_voltage
```

**Example:**
```
actual_system_voltage = 181 * 3.6 = 651.6V
```

#### e. Determine Number of Parallel Cells

The number of cells connected in parallel is calculated by dividing the total ampere-hours needed by the usable capacity of a single cell, then rounding up.

```python
num_parallel = ceil(total_ah_needed / usable_capacity)
```

**Example:**
If `total_ah_needed = 60000 Wh / 650V = 92.31 Ah` and `usable_capacity = 14.4 Ah`:
```
num_parallel = ceil(92.31 / 14.4) = 7 cells in parallel
```

#### f. Compute Total Number of Cells

The total number of cells required for the battery system is the product of the number of series and parallel cells.

```python
total_cells = num_series * num_parallel
```

**Example:**
```
total_cells = 181 * 7 = 1267 cells
```

#### g. Calculate Total Capacity and Energy

Finally, the total capacity and energy of the battery system are calculated.

```python
total_capacity_ah = num_parallel * usable_capacity
total_energy_kwh = (actual_system_voltage * total_capacity_ah) / 1000
```

**Example:**
```
total_capacity_ah = 7 * 14.4 = 100.8 Ah
total_energy_kwh = (651.6 * 100.8) / 1000 = 65.69 kWh
```

### 4. Flexibility for Different Models

Battery systems often require multiple configurations to cater to varying energy and voltage demands. By adjusting the number of series and parallel cells, different models can be designed to meet specific requirements.

**Example:**

- **Model 1**: 650V, 60kWh
- **Model 2**: 650V, 115kWh

Each model would have a different number of parallel cells to achieve the desired energy while maintaining the same system voltage.

### 5. Output Configuration

The final configuration provides a detailed breakdown of the battery system, including:

- **Number of Series Cells**: Determines the total voltage.
- **Number of Parallel Cells**: Determines the total capacity.
- **Total Cells Required**: Overall count of cells needed.
- **Actual System Voltage**: Verified system voltage based on series connections.
- **Total Capacity**: Total ampere-hours available.
- **Total Energy**: Total energy stored in the battery system.

## Implementing Battery Sizing in Python

While Excel offers a flexible platform for battery sizing, Python provides automation, scalability, and enhanced computational capabilities. The following sections detail a Python implementation that mirrors the battery sizing process described above.

### Python Script Overview

The Python script encapsulates the battery sizing process into structured classes and functions, enabling users to input design parameters and receive detailed configurations automatically.

**Key Components:**

1. **Data Classes**: Define the characteristics of battery cells and design parameters.
2. **Calculation Functions**: Perform the necessary computations to determine the battery configuration.
3. **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple design scenarios simultaneously.
4. **Main Function**: Demonstrates the usage of the script with example configurations.

### Detailed Code Explanation

#### 1. Defining Data Classes

Data classes provide a convenient way to store and manage battery cell characteristics and design parameters.

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

@dataclass
class BatteryCell:
    nominal_voltage: float  # Voltage per cell in volts (V)
    usable_capacity: float  # Usable capacity per cell in ampere-hours (Ah)

@dataclass
class BatteryDesignParameters:
    desired_energy_kwh: float     # Desired energy in kilowatt-hours (kWh)
    system_voltage: float         # Desired system voltage in volts (V)
    buffer_percentage: float      # Depth of discharge (e.g., 80 for 80%)
```

**Explanation:**

- `BatteryCell`: Represents a single battery cell's nominal voltage and usable capacity.
- `BatteryDesignParameters`: Encapsulates the design requirements, including desired energy, system voltage, and buffer percentage.

#### 2. Calculating Battery Configuration

The `calculate_battery_configuration` function performs the core calculations to determine the number of series and parallel cells required.

```python
from math import ceil

def calculate_battery_configuration(cell: BatteryCell, design: BatteryDesignParameters):
    """
    Calculate the battery configuration based on cell specifications and design parameters.
    
    Returns a dictionary with the configuration details.
    """
    # Adjust buffer percentage
    usable_capacity = cell.usable_capacity * (design.buffer_percentage / 100)
    
    # Calculate total ampere-hours needed
    total_ah_needed = (design.desired_energy_kwh * 1000) / design.system_voltage
    
    # Calculate number of series cells (must be integer)
    num_series = ceil(design.system_voltage / cell.nominal_voltage)
    
    # Recalculate actual system voltage based on integer series cells
    actual_system_voltage = num_series * cell.nominal_voltage
    
    # Calculate number of parallel cells (must be integer)
    num_parallel = ceil(total_ah_needed / usable_capacity)
    
    # Total number of cells
    total_cells = num_series * num_parallel
    
    # Total capacity in Ah
    total_capacity_ah = num_parallel * usable_capacity
    
    # Total energy in kWh
    total_energy_kwh = (actual_system_voltage * total_capacity_ah) / 1000
    
    return {
        'number_of_series_cells': num_series,
        'number_of_parallel_cells': num_parallel,
        'total_cells': total_cells,
        'actual_system_voltage': actual_system_voltage,
        'total_capacity_ah': total_capacity_ah,
        'total_energy_kwh': total_energy_kwh
    }
```

**Explanation:**

- **Buffer Adjustment**: Modifies the usable capacity based on the buffer percentage to prevent full discharge.
- **Total Ampere-Hours Calculation**: Converts the desired energy from kWh to Ah based on the system voltage.
- **Series Cells Determination**: Calculates the number of cells needed in series to achieve the system voltage, ensuring the count is an integer.
- **Parallel Cells Determination**: Calculates the number of cells needed in parallel to meet the required capacity, ensuring the count is an integer.
- **Total Cells and Energy**: Computes the overall number of cells and verifies the total energy of the configured battery system.

#### 3. Batch Calculations for Multiple Models

The `batch_calculate_configurations` function allows users to input multiple design scenarios and receive configurations for each.

```python
def batch_calculate_configurations(cell: BatteryCell, designs: list):
    """
    Calculate configurations for a batch of design parameters.
    
    Returns a dictionary with model names as keys and configuration details as values.
    """
    configurations = {}
    for design in designs:
        config = calculate_battery_configuration(cell, design)
        model_name = f"{design.system_voltage}V_{design.desired_energy_kwh}kWh"
        configurations[model_name] = config
    return configurations
```

**Explanation:**

- Iterates through a list of design parameters.
- Computes the configuration for each design.
- Assigns a descriptive model name based on system voltage and desired energy.
- Aggregates all configurations into a single dictionary for easy reference.

#### 4. Main Function Demonstration

The `main` function serves as an example of how to utilize the script with predefined cell characteristics and design parameters.

```python
def main():
    # Define a single battery cell
    cell = BatteryCell(
        nominal_voltage=3.6,   # Example: 3.6V per cell

    )
    
    # Define multiple design parameters (different models)
    designs = [
        BatteryDesignParameters(desired_energy_kwh=60, system_voltage=650, buffer_percentage=80),
        BatteryDesignParameters(desired_energy_kwh=115, system_voltage=650, buffer_percentage=80),
        # Additional designs can be added here
    ]
    
    # Calculate configurations for all designs
    configurations = batch_calculate_configurations(cell, designs)
    
    # Display the results
    for model, config in configurations.items():
        print(f"Model: {model}")
        print(f"  Number of Series Cells: {config['number_of_series_cells']}")
