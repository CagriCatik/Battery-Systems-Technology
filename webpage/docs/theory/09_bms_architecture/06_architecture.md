# BMS Architectural Design

A Battery Management System is an essential component for modern energy storage systems. Its role is to monitor and manage the battery packâ€™s state, ensuring safe, efficient, and prolonged operation. The BMS handles tasks such as cell monitoring, state-of-charge estimation, balancing, fault detection, and communication with higher-level systems.

The architectural design of a BMS generally follows a modular approach, separating the monitoring, control, communication, and power modules into distinct layers. This separation of concerns not only makes the system scalable but also simplifies both troubleshooting and upgrades.

## Architectural Components

The BMS architecture can be divided into the following primary modules:

1. **Cell Monitoring Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Continuously measures cell voltage, current, and temperature.  
   - **Components:** Voltage sensors, temperature sensors, current sensors.

2. **Balancing Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Ensures that all cells within the battery pack are maintained at similar charge levels to optimize performance and lifespan.  
   - **Components:** Passive or active balancing circuits.

3. **Control Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Acts as the brain of the BMS, processing sensor inputs, running diagnostic routines, and executing control strategies.  
   - **Components:** Microcontroller/processor, firmware for control algorithms.

4. **Communication Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Manages communication with external systems such as vehicle control units, data logging systems, or remote monitoring services.  
   - **Components:** CAN bus interface

5. **Power Distribution Module**  
   - **Purpose:** Manages the distribution of power between the battery pack and the connected load, ensuring safe current flow.  
   - **Components:** Relays, contactors, power switches.
