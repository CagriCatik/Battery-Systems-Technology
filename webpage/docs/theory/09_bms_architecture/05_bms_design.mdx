# BMS Design

The design of a Battery Management System (BMS) is a multifaceted process that integrates hardware, software, and control algorithms to ensure the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of battery systems. Effective BMS design is crucial for optimizing battery performance, extending lifespan, and ensuring safety in applications such as electric vehicles (EVs), renewable energy storage, and portable electronics. This chapter provides an in-depth exploration of the BMS design process, focusing on input/output architecture, control logic, and the implementation of key functionalities such as State of Charge (SoC) and State of Health (SoH) estimation.

## BMS Input/Output Architecture

The foundation of a robust BMS design lies in its input/output (I/O) architecture, which facilitates the seamless collection, processing, and dissemination of critical data. The architecture comprises **slave units**, a **master controller**, and various **communication interfaces** that interconnect these components.

### Inputs to the BMS

The BMS receives inputs from multiple sources to accurately monitor and manage the battery system. These inputs are essential for real-time decision-making and control actions.

- **Sensor Data**: The BMS collects data from an array of sensors integrated into the battery modules. These sensors provide real-time measurements of key parameters, including:
  - **Voltage Sensors**: Measure the voltage of individual cells or modules to monitor charge levels and detect imbalances.
  - **Current Sensors**: Track the current flowing into (charging) or out of (discharging) the battery to manage power flow and prevent overcurrent conditions.
  - **Temperature Sensors**: Monitor the thermal state of the battery modules to prevent overheating or excessive cooling, which can degrade battery performance and safety.

- **Mode Request**: The Vehicle Control Unit (VCU) sends mode requests to the BMS, indicating the desired operating state of the battery. The primary modes include:
  - **Charge Mode**: Indicates that the battery is being charged.
  - **Discharge Mode**: Indicates that the battery is supplying power to the vehicle.
  - **Idle Mode**: Indicates that the battery is neither charging nor discharging.

- **Balancing Control Inputs**: The BMS receives commands to manage cell balancing, ensuring uniform voltage levels across all cells to maximize battery efficiency and lifespan. This includes instructions to activate or deactivate balancing circuits based on real-time data.

### Outputs from the BMS

Based on the processed inputs, the BMS generates various outputs to control and communicate with other system components, ensuring optimal battery performance and safety.

- **Control Signals**: The BMS dispatches control signals to manage different aspects of the battery system:
  - **Slave Units**: Sends instructions for cell balancing, such as activating or deactivating balancing circuits to maintain voltage uniformity across cells.
  - **VCU**: Transmits information about the battery's state, including SoC, SoH, temperature, and current limits, enabling the VCU to make informed decisions regarding vehicle operations.
  - **Motor Controller**: Provides current limits for discharging to prevent overcurrent conditions that could damage the motor or battery.
  - **Charger**: Delivers current limits for charging to avoid overcharging, which can lead to battery degradation or safety hazards.

- **Safety Actions**: In response to critical sensor data, the BMS can trigger safety mechanisms to protect the battery system:
  - **Thermal Management Systems**: Activates cooling or heating systems to maintain optimal temperature ranges.
  - **Emergency Shutdowns**: Initiates shutdown procedures in case of extreme conditions, such as overvoltage, overcurrent, or thermal runaway, to prevent catastrophic failures.

## Control Logic in BMS Design

The control logic within a BMS is the heart of its operation, governing how the system responds to various inputs to maintain battery integrity and performance. Operating as a **closed-loop control system**, the BMS continuously receives feedback from sensors to adjust its control actions dynamically.

### Mode Request Handling

Handling mode requests is the initial step in the BMS control logic, determining the operational state of the battery based on external commands.

- **Receiving Mode Requests**: The VCU sends mode requests to the BMS, specifying whether the battery should be in charge, discharge, or idle mode.
- **Determining Control Actions**: Based on the received mode, the BMS decides which control actions to execute. For example:
  - **Charge Mode**: Enables charging circuits and manages charging rates.
  - **Discharge Mode**: Activates discharging pathways and regulates power delivery to the motor controller.
  - **Idle Mode**: Disables both charging and discharging to conserve battery life when the vehicle is stationary.

```c
// Example Mode Request Handling
typedef enum {
    MODE_DISCHARGE,
    MODE_CHARGE,
    MODE_IDLE
} BMS_Mode;

BMS_Mode current_mode;

void receiveModeRequest(BMS_Mode mode) {
    current_mode = mode;
    executeMode(current_mode);
}

void executeMode(BMS_Mode mode) {
    switch(mode) {
        case MODE_DISCHARGE:
            enableDischarge();
            disableCharge();
            break;
        case MODE_CHARGE:
            enableCharge();
            disableDischarge();
            break;
        case MODE_IDLE:
            disableCharge();
            disableDischarge();
            break;
    }
}
```

  :Disable Discharging;
endif
:Read Sensor Data;
:Estimate SoC and SoH;
if (Safety Limit Exceeded?) then (yes)

endif
stop

### State Estimation

Accurate estimation of critical battery parameters is essential for informed decision-making within the BMS. The BMS employs algorithms to estimate the **State of Charge (SoC)** and **State of Health (SoH)** of the battery.

- **State of Charge (SoC)**: Represents the remaining charge in the battery, typically expressed as a percentage. SoC estimation helps in predicting the driving range of EVs and managing charging cycles.
- **State of Health (SoH)**: Indicates the overall condition and longevity of the battery. SoH assessment considers factors like capacity loss and internal resistance, providing insights into battery degradation over time.

```c
// Example Data Processing for SoC Estimation
float current = readCurrentSensor();
float delta_time = getDeltaTime();
float initial_SOC = getInitialSOC();
float battery_capacity = getBatteryCapacity();

float new_SOC = estimate_SOC(current, delta_time, initial_SOC, battery_capacity);
updateSOC(new_SOC);
```

### Cell Balancing

Cell balancing ensures that all cells within a battery module operate at similar voltage levels, preventing overcharging or deep discharging of individual cells, which can degrade battery performance and lifespan.

- **Monitoring Cell Voltages**: The BMS continuously monitors the voltage of each cell to identify imbalances.
- **Activating Balancing Circuits**: When significant voltage differences are detected, the BMS activates balancing circuits to equalize the cell voltages. Balancing can be achieved through:
  - **Passive Balancing**: Discharges higher-voltage cells through resistors to match lower-voltage cells.
  - **Active Balancing**: Transfers charge from higher-voltage cells to lower-voltage cells using inductors or capacitors, enhancing overall efficiency.

```c
// Example Cell Balancing Control
void balanceCells() {
    for(int i = 0; i < NUM_CELLS; i++) {
        if(cell_voltage[i] > BALANCE_THRESHOLD_HIGH) {
            activatePassiveBalancing(i);
        } else if(cell_voltage[i] < BALANCE_THRESHOLD_LOW) {
            deactivateBalancing(i);
        }
    }
}
```

### Safety and Limit Enforcement

Safety is paramount in BMS design, with the system enforcing various operational limits to prevent hazardous conditions.

- **Maximum Current Limiting**: Restricts the current during charging or discharging to prevent overheating, overcurrent, and potential damage to the battery or vehicle components.
- **Temperature Regulation**: Monitors battery temperature and activates thermal management systems to maintain temperatures within safe operating ranges.
- **Voltage Protection**: Prevents overcharging or deep discharging of cells by enforcing voltage limits, thereby safeguarding battery integrity.

```c
// Example Safety Limit Enforcement
void enforceSafetyLimits() {
    float current_temperature = readTemperatureSensor();
    float current_voltage = readVoltageSensor();
    float current_current = readCurrentSensor();
    
    if(current_temperature > MAX_TEMPERATURE) {
        activateCoolingSystem();
        limitCurrent(MAX_DISCHARGE_CURRENT);
    } else if(current_temperature < MIN_TEMPERATURE) {
        activateHeatingSystem();
        limitCurrent(MAX_CHARGE_CURRENT);
    }
    
    if(current_voltage > MAX_CELL_VOLTAGE) {
        disableCharging();
    } else if(current_voltage < MIN_CELL_VOLTAGE) {
        disableDischarging();
    }
    
    if(current_current > MAX_DISCHARGE_CURRENT) {
        limitCurrent(MAX_DISCHARGE_CURRENT);
    } else if(current_current < -MAX_CHARGE_CURRENT) {
        limitCurrent(-MAX_CHARGE_CURRENT);
    }
}
```

## Implementation of SoC and SoH Estimation

Accurate estimation of SoC and SoH is critical for effective battery management. The BMS design incorporates various algorithms and methodologies to achieve precise estimations.

### SoC Estimation

SoC estimation determines the remaining charge in the battery, essential for predicting range and managing charging cycles. Several methods are employed to estimate SoC, each with its advantages and limitations.

#### Coulomb Counting

Coulomb counting involves integrating the current over time to estimate the charge added or removed from the battery. This method is straightforward but can accumulate errors over time due to sensor inaccuracies and integration drift.

```c
// Function to estimate State of Charge (SoC) using Coulomb Counting
float estimate_SOC(float current, float delta_time, float initial_SOC, float battery_capacity) {
    // current: Current in amperes
    // delta_time: Time interval in seconds
    // initial_SOC: SoC at the beginning of the interval (0-100%)
    // battery_capacity: Total battery capacity in ampere-hours (Ah)
    
    // Convert battery capacity to coulombs
    float battery_capacity_coulombs = battery_capacity * 3600.0;
    
    // Calculate charge change
    float delta_charge = current * delta_time;
    
    // Update SoC
    float new_SOC = initial_SOC - (delta_charge / battery_capacity_coulombs) * 100.0;
    
    // Clamp SoC between 0% and 100%
    if (new_SOC > 100.0) new_SOC = 100.0;
    if (new_SOC < 0.0) new_SOC = 0.0;
    
    return new_SOC;
}
```

#### Open-Circuit Voltage Method

The OCV method estimates SoC based on the relationship between the battery's open-circuit voltage and its SoC. This method requires the battery to rest without charging or discharging to obtain an accurate voltage reading.

```c
// Function to estimate SoC using OCV Method
float estimate_SOC_OCV(float ocv) {
    // ocv: Open-Circuit Voltage in volts
    // Lookup table mapping OCV to SoC
    float soc = lookup_SOC_from_OCV(ocv);
    return soc;
}
```

#### Kalman Filters

Kalman Filters provide a sophisticated approach to SoC estimation by accounting for measurement noise and system uncertainties. Variants like Extended Kalman Filters (EKF) and Unscented Kalman Filters (UKF) are particularly effective for non-linear battery systems.

```c
// Example of a simple Kalman Filter implementation for SoC estimation
float kalmanFilter(float measurement, float estimated, float uncertainty_estimated, float uncertainty_measurement) {
    float kalman_gain = uncertainty_estimated / (uncertainty_estimated + uncertainty_measurement);
    float updated_estimate = estimated + kalman_gain * (measurement - estimated);
    float updated_uncertainty = (1 - kalman_gain) * uncertainty_estimated;
    return updated_estimate;
}
```

### SoH Estimation

SoH estimation assesses the battery's overall condition and longevity, providing insights into capacity loss and degradation over time.

#### Capacity Loss Calculation

SoH is determined by comparing the current capacity of the battery with its original capacity. This metric indicates how much the battery has degraded.

```c
// Function to estimate State of Health (SoH) based on capacity loss
float estimate_SOH(float current_capacity, float original_capacity) {
    float soh = (current_capacity / original_capacity) * 100.0;
    return soh;
}
```

#### Cycle Counting

Cycle counting tracks the number of charge-discharge cycles the battery has undergone. Each cycle contributes to capacity fade and internal resistance increase.

```c
// Function to estimate SoH based on cycle counting
float estimate_SOH_cycles(int total_cycles, float capacity_loss_per_cycle) {
    float total_capacity_loss = total_cycles * capacity_loss_per_cycle;
    float soh = 100.0 - total_capacity_loss;
    if (soh < 0.0) soh = 0.0;
    return soh;
}
```

#### Lookup Tables

Lookup tables map the number of cycles or other parameters to estimated SoH, providing a quick reference for SoH estimation based on empirical data.

```c
// Function to estimate SoH using Lookup Tables
float estimate_SOH_lookup(int cycle_count) {
    // Example lookup table
    float lookup_table[] = {100, 99, 98, 97, 96, 95}; // SoH percentages
    int table_size = sizeof(lookup_table) / sizeof(lookup_table[0]);
    
    if(cycle_count < table_size) {
        return lookup_table[cycle_count];
    } else {
        return lookup_table[table_size - 1]; // Minimum SoH
    }
}
```
