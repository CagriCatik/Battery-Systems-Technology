  ```c
  // Example of a simple Kalman Filter implementation for SOC estimation
  float kalmanFilter(float measurement, float estimated, float uncertainty_estimated, float uncertainty_measurement) {
      float kalman_gain = uncertainty_estimated / (uncertainty_estimated + uncertainty_measurement);
      float updated_estimate = estimated + kalman_gain * (measurement - estimated);
      float updated_uncertainty = (1 - kalman_gain) * uncertainty_estimated;
      return updated_estimate;
  }
  ```
