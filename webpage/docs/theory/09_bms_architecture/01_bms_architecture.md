## 1. Overview of BMS Architecture

The BMS functions as the brain of the battery system, orchestrating various operations to maintain optimal battery performance. Unlike traditional engine control units (ECUs) that typically rely on a single hardware board, the BMS employs a **distributed architecture**. This architecture comprises multiple interconnected components, primarily categorized into **slave units** and a **master controller**. The distributed nature allows for precise monitoring and control of individual battery modules and cells, enhancing both performance and safety.

### Distributed vs. Centralized Architecture

- **Distributed Architecture**: Utilizes multiple slave units to manage different sections of the battery pack, allowing for scalability and localized control.
- **Centralized Architecture**: Relies on a single controller to manage all aspects of the battery pack, which can be simpler but less flexible and scalable.

The distributed architecture is preferred in modern EVs due to its ability to handle complex battery configurations and provide robust fault tolerance.

## 3. Communication Between Slave Units and Master Controller

Effective communication between slave units and the master controller is paramount for the BMS's functionality. The BMS typically employs the **Controller Area Network (CAN) bus** protocol to facilitate this communication.

### CAN Bus Overview

- **Protocol**: A robust vehicle bus standard designed to allow microcontrollers and devices to communicate without a host computer.
- **Advantages**:
  - **Reliability**: High resistance to electrical noise and interference.
  - **Efficiency**: Supports high-speed data transmission with minimal latency.
  - **Scalability**: Easily accommodates additional nodes (slave units) without significant reconfiguration.

### Communication Components

1. **CAN Wiring Harness**:
   - The physical network that connects all slave units to the master controller.
   - Ensures consistent and reliable data transmission across the entire battery pack.

2. **Data Transmission Process**:
   - **From Slave Units**: Slave units send raw sensor data, including voltage, current, and temperature readings, to the master controller.
   - **From Master Controller**: Processes the incoming data and sends back control commands, such as adjusting charging rates or activating safety mechanisms.

### Example CAN Message Structure

```c
// Example CAN message structure for voltage data from a slave unit
typedef struct {
    uint32_t timestamp;     // Time of data transmission
    uint8_t slave_id;       // Identifier for the slave unit
    float cell_voltage[16]; // Voltage readings for 16 cells in the module
} CAN_Message_Voltage;
```

This structure ensures that each voltage reading is accurately timestamped and associated with the correct slave unit, facilitating precise data processing by the master controller.

```c
// Function to estimate State of Charge (SOC) using Coulomb Counting
float estimate_SOC(float current, float delta_time, float initial_SOC, float battery_capacity) {
    // current: Current in amperes
    // delta_time: Time interval in seconds
    // initial_SOC: SOC at the beginning of the interval (0-100%)
    // battery_capacity: Total battery capacity in ampere-hours (Ah)
    
    // Convert battery capacity to coulombs
    float battery_capacity_coulombs = battery_capacity * 3600.0;
    
    // Calculate charge change
    float delta_charge = current * delta_time;
    
    // Update SOC
    float new_SOC = initial_SOC - (delta_charge / battery_capacity_coulombs) * 100.0;
    
    // Clamp SOC between 0% and 100%
    if (new_SOC > 100.0) new_SOC = 100.0;
    if (new_SOC < 0.0) new_SOC = 0.0;
    
    return new_SOC;
}
```

This function calculates the SOC by accounting for the charge consumed or added over a specific time interval, providing a continuous estimate of the battery's charge level.
