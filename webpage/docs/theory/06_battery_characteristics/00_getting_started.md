# Getting Started

1. **OCV vs. SOC for Chemistries**
   - **Open Circuit Voltage (OCV)**: This refers to the voltage of a battery when no current is being drawn or supplied. It provides insight into the battery's internal electrochemical balance and potential energy.
   - **State of Charge (SOC)**: SOC is the percentage of the battery’s remaining capacity relative to its full capacity. Accurate SOC estimation is essential for battery management systems (BMS) to avoid overcharging or deep discharging.
   - **Relation Between OCV and SOC**: Different battery chemistries exhibit unique OCV-SOC curves. These curves help define the behavior of the battery under varying charge levels and are critical for calibrating battery monitoring systems.
   
   - **Technical Considerations:**
        - Measure OCV-SOC curves for specific chemistries (e.g., lithium-ion, nickel-metal hydride).
        - Use OCV as a non-invasive method to estimate SOC under stable conditions.
        - Understand how temperature and aging affect OCV-SOC accuracy.

2. **Battery Cell Specification Sheet**
   A battery cell specification sheet outlines the technical and operational limits of a cell. It provides essential details necessary for safe and optimal integration into a battery pack.
   
   **Common Parameters:**
   - **Nominal Voltage**: The typical operating voltage of the cell (e.g., 3.7V for lithium-ion).
   - **Capacity (Ah)**: The amount of charge the battery can hold, often measured in ampere-hours.
   - **Energy Density**: Specifies the energy stored per unit mass or volume, which influences the pack size and weight.
   - **Maximum Discharge Current**: The highest current the cell can safely supply without damage.
   - **Charging Parameters**: Includes the recommended charging voltage, current limits, and charging profiles (e.g., CC-CV – Constant Current followed by Constant Voltage).
   - **Cycle Life**: The number of full charge/discharge cycles the cell can undergo before its capacity degrades significantly.
   - **Operating Temperature Range**: Defines the safe temperature limits for charging and discharging the cell.
