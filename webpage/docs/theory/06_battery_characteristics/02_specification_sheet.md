```python
# Example: Simple SoC Estimation Using Coulomb Counting

class BatterySOC:
    def __init__(self, capacity_ah, initial_soc=1.0):
        self.capacity_ah = capacity_ah  # Total capacity in Ah
        self.soc = initial_soc            # Initial State of Charge (0.0 to 1.0)
        self.charge_accumulator = 0.0     # Accumulated charge in Ah

    def update_soc(self, current_a, delta_time_h):
        """
        Update the State of Charge based on current and time.

        :param current_a: Current in amperes (positive for charging, negative for discharging)
        :param delta_time_h: Time interval in hours
        """
        self.charge_accumulator += current_a * delta_time_h
        self.soc += self.charge_accumulator / self.capacity_ah
        self.soc = max(0.0, min(1.0, self.soc))  # Clamp SoC between 0 and 1
        self.charge_accumulator = 0.0  # Reset accumulator after update

    def get_soc_percentage(self):
        return self.soc * 100

# Example usage
battery = BatterySOC(capacity_ah=2.6)  # 2.6 Ah battery

# Simulate discharging at 1 A for 1 hour
battery.update_soc(current_a=-1.0, delta_time_h=1.0)

       $$
       \text{Energy} = 200 \text{ km} \times 150 \text{ Wh/km} = 30,000 \text{ Wh} = 30 \text{ kWh}
       $$

3. **Capacity Calculation**
   - **Divide Energy by System Voltage:**
     $$
     \text{Capacity (Ah)} = \frac{\text{Energy (kWh)}}{\text{System Voltage (V)}}
     $$
     - *Example:* For a 30 kWh system operating at 400 V:
       $$
       \text{Capacity} = \frac{30,000 \text{ Wh}}{400 \text{ V}} = 75 \text{ Ah}
       $$

4. **Buffer and Aging Factors**

     - *Example:* For a required capacity of 75 Ah:
       $$
       \text{Total Capacity} = 75 \text{ Ah} \times 1.20 = 90 \text{ Ah}
       $$

5. **Temperature Considerations**
   - **Design for Operating Conditions:** Incorporate thermal management solutions, such as heating elements or cooling systems, to maintain optimal battery temperatures in varying climates.

6. **Power and Load Profiles**

    # Step 3: Capacity Calculation
    capacity_ah = (energy_kwh * 1000) / system_voltage_v  # Convert kWh to Wh and divide by voltage

    # Step 4: Buffer and Aging
    total_capacity_ah = capacity_ah * (1 + buffer_percentage / 100)

    return {
        'energy_kwh': energy_kwh,
        'capacity_ah': capacity_ah,
        'total_capacity_ah': total_capacity_ah
    }
