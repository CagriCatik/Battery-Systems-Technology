class BatteryManagementSystem:
    def __init__(self, nominal_capacity):
        self.nominal_capacity = nominal_capacity  # in Ah
        self.soc = 100.0  # State of Charge in percentage
        self.current = 0.0  # Current in Amperes
        self.time_interval = 1  # Time interval in seconds

    def update_current(self, current_reading):
        self.current = current_reading

    def estimate_soc(self):
        # Coulomb Counting: SoC = SoC_previous - (I * Δt / Q) * 100
        delta_soc = (self.current * self.time_interval) / (self.nominal_capacity * 3600) * 100
        self.soc -= delta_soc
        # Ensure SoC remains within 0-100%
        self.soc = max(0.0, min(self.soc, 100.0))
        return self.soc

# Example Usage
bms = BatteryManagementSystem(nominal_capacity=50)  # 50 Ah battery

    def check_current(self, current):
        if abs(current) > self.max_current:
            self.trigger_protection()
            return False
        return True

    def trigger_protection(self):
        print("Over-current detected! Initiating protection measures.")
        # Implement shutdown or current limiting logic here

# Example Usage
ocp = OverCurrentProtection(max_current=20)  # 20 A limit
current_reading = 25  # Current exceeds limit

        self.kd = kd
        self.setpoint = setpoint
        self.integral = 0.0
        self.previous_error = 0.0

    def compute(self, measurement):
        error = self.setpoint - measurement
        self.integral += error
        derivative = error - self.previous_error
        output = self.kp * error + self.ki * self.integral + self.kd * derivative
        self.previous_error = error
        return output

# Example Usage
pid = PIDController(kp=1.0, ki=0.1, kd=0.05, setpoint=25.0)  # Target temperature 25°C
current_temp = 30.0  # Current temperature
control_signal = pid.compute(current_temp)
print(f"Control Signal: {control_signal}")
# Use control_signal to adjust cooling/heating systems
```

*Explanation:* This PID controller adjusts the cooling or heating systems based on the difference between the desired setpoint and the actual temperature, ensuring the battery operates within safe thermal limits.
