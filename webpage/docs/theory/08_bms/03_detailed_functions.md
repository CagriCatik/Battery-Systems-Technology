class OverCurrentProtection:
    def __init__(self, max_current, trigger_threshold=1.05):
        """
        Initializes the Over Current Protection system.
        
        :param max_current: Maximum allowable current in Amperes
        :param trigger_threshold: Multiplier to determine when to trigger protection
        """
        self.max_current = max_current
        self.trigger_threshold = trigger_threshold  # e.g., 1.05 for 5% tolerance

    def check_current(self, current):
        """
        Checks if the current exceeds the maximum allowable limit.
        
        :param current: Current flowing through the battery in Amperes
        :return: Boolean indicating if current is within safe limits
        """
        if abs(current) > self.max_current * self.trigger_threshold:
            self.trigger_protection()
            return False
        return True

    def trigger_protection(self):
        """
        Initiates protective measures when over-current is detected.
        """
        print("Over-current detected! Initiating protection measures.")
        # Implement protective actions here (e.g., disconnect contactors)

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define maximum allowable current (e.g., 20 A)
    max_current = 20  # in Amperes

    # Initialize Over Current Protection
    ocp = OverCurrentProtection(max_current=max_current)

    # Simulate current readings
    current_readings = [15, 22, 18, 25, 19]

    for current in current_readings:
        print(f"Current Reading: {current} A")
        if not ocp.check_current(current):
            print("Protection triggered. Taking necessary actions.\n")
        else:
            print("Current within safe limits.\n")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** The `OverCurrentProtection` class is initialized with a maximum allowable current and a trigger threshold that adds a margin for safety.

        control_signal = self.pid.compute(current_temp)
        if control_signal > 0:

            self.heating_power = 0.0
        elif control_signal < 0:
            self.heating_power = min(-control_signal, 100)  # Limit heating power to 100%

        else:
            self.heating_power = 0.0
            self.cooling_power = 0.0
        self.apply_thermal_control()

    def apply_thermal_control(self):
        """
        Applies the calculated heating or cooling power to regulate temperature.
        """
        if self.heating_power > 0:
            print(f"Heating Power Applied: {self.heating_power:.2f}%")
            # Implement heating control logic here
        elif self.cooling_power > 0:
            print(f"Cooling Power Applied: {self.cooling_power:.2f}%")
            # Implement cooling control logic here
        else:
            print("Thermal conditions optimal. No action required.")

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define PID gains and setpoint
    kp = 2.0
    ki = 0.5
    kd = 1.0
    setpoint = 25.0  # Desired temperature in Celsius

    # Initialize Thermal Management System
    tms = ThermalManagementSystem(setpoint, kp, ki, kd)

    # Simulate temperature readings
    temperature_readings = [23.0, 24.5, 25.0, 26.0, 27.5, 25.0, 24.0]

    for temp in temperature_readings:
        print(f"Current Temperature: {temp} °C")
        tms.regulate_temperature(temp)
        print()
```

**Explanation:**

- **PID Controller:** The `PIDController` class computes the control signal based on the difference between the desired setpoint and the current temperature measurement. It accounts for proportional, integral, and derivative components to provide a balanced control action.
  
- **Thermal Management System:** The `ThermalManagementSystem` class utilizes the PID controller to determine the necessary heating or cooling power. It ensures that the applied power does not exceed 100% and adjusts the heating or cooling systems accordingly.
  
- **Usage Example:** Demonstrates how to initialize the thermal management system with specific PID gains and a setpoint, and how to regulate temperature based on a series of temperature readings.

### 4. Communication Interface with CAN Bus

Effective communication between the BMS and other vehicle or system controllers is essential for coordinated operations. The following example demonstrates how to implement a CAN bus communication interface within a BMS.

```python
import can

class BMS_CAN_Interface:
    def __init__(self, channel='can0', bustype='socketcan'):
        """
        Initializes the CAN interface for the BMS.
        
        :param channel: CAN channel identifier (e.g., 'can0')
        :param bustype: Type of CAN interface (e.g., 'socketcan')
        """
        self.bus = can.interface.Bus(channel=channel, bustype=bustype)

    def send_soc(self, soc):
        """
        Sends the State of Charge (SoC) over the CAN bus.
        
        :param soc: State of Charge percentage
        """
        message = can.Message(arbitration_id=0x100,
                              data=[int(soc), 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00, 0x00],
                              is_extended_id=False)
        try:
            self.bus.send(message)
            print(f"SoC {soc}% sent on CAN bus.")
        except can.CanError:
            print("Failed to send SoC message.")

    def receive_message(self, timeout=1.0):
        """
        Receives a message from the CAN bus.
        
        :param timeout: Time to wait for a message in seconds
        :return: Received message or None
        """
        message = self.bus.recv(timeout)
        if message:
            print(f"Received message: ID={hex(message.arbitration_id)} Data={message.data}")
            return message
        else:
            print("No message received.")
            return None

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Initialize CAN interface
    can_interface = BMS_CAN_Interface()

    # Send SoC value
    soc_value = 85  # Example SoC percentage
    can_interface.send_soc(soc_value)

    # Receive a message
    received_msg = can_interface.receive_message()
```

**Explanation:**

- **Initialization:** The `BMS_CAN_Interface` class sets up the CAN bus using specified channel and bustype parameters.
  
- **Sending SoC:** The `send_soc` method constructs a CAN message with the SoC value and sends it over the CAN bus. The arbitration ID `0x100` is used as an example and can be adjusted based on application requirements.
  
- **Receiving Messages:** The `receive_message` method listens for incoming CAN messages and processes them, displaying the message ID and data payload.
  
- **Usage Example:** Demonstrates how to initialize the CAN interface, send an SoC value, and receive messages, showcasing the communication flow between the BMS and external systems.
