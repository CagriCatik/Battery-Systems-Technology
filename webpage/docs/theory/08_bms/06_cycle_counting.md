# Cycle Counting and State of Health Estimation

Battery Management Systems (BMS) play a crucial role in ensuring the optimal performance, safety, and longevity of lithium-ion batteries. One of the fundamental methods employed for estimating the **State of Health (SoH)** of a battery is **Cycle Counting**. This method involves tracking the number of charge-discharge cycles a battery undergoes, as each cycle contributes to the battery's aging and capacity degradation. Accurate SoH estimation through cycle counting is essential for applications such as electric vehicles, renewable energy storage systems, and portable electronics, where battery reliability and lifespan are paramount.

The **State of Health (SoH)** of a battery provides insights into its current condition relative to its ideal state, often expressed as a percentage. Accurate SoH estimation is vital for predicting battery lifespan, scheduling maintenance, and ensuring reliable performance. **Cycle Counting** serves as a foundational method for SoH estimation by tracking the number of charge-discharge cycles a battery undergoes. Each cycle contributes to the natural aging process of the battery, leading to capacity fade and increased internal resistance.

This chapter explores the principles of cycle counting, its implementation within a BMS, the factors influencing battery degradation, and advanced techniques to enhance SoH estimation accuracy. Through detailed explanations and practical code examples, this documentation aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of cycle counting and its role in battery health management.

## Understanding Battery Cycles

### What Constitutes a Battery Cycle?

A **battery cycle** refers to the process of charging a battery from a lower **State of Charge (SoC)** to its maximum capacity and then discharging it back to the initial SoC. In practice, batteries rarely undergo full cycles; instead, they experience **partial cycles**, where they are charged and discharged within specific SoC ranges. For example, charging a battery from 50% to 100% SoC and then discharging it back to 50% constitutes one full cycle, even though only 50% of the battery's capacity was utilized.

### Equivalent Full Cycles

To account for partial cycles, the concept of **equivalent full cycles** is employed. This metric aggregates partial cycles into full cycle equivalents based on the cumulative Depth of Discharge (DoD). For instance, two 50% partial cycles equate to one full cycle. Tracking equivalent full cycles provides a more accurate representation of the battery's usage and degradation over time.

### Importance of Cycle Counting

- **SoH Estimation:** Helps in predicting the remaining useful life of the battery.
- **Maintenance Scheduling:** Enables timely maintenance and replacement to prevent unexpected failures.
- **Performance Optimization:** Assists in understanding usage patterns and optimizing charging strategies to extend battery lifespan.

## Cycle Counting Algorithm

Implementing a cycle counting algorithm involves several key steps, each contributing to accurate SoH estimation. Below is a detailed breakdown of each step.

### 1. Data Acquisition

**Objective:** Continuously monitor and record the battery's operational parameters, such as voltage, current, and temperature.

- **Voltage Monitoring:** Measures the voltage of individual cells and the entire battery pack to assess charge levels and detect anomalies.
- **Current Monitoring:** Tracks the flow of current into (charging) and out of (discharging) the battery.
- **Temperature Monitoring:** Ensures the battery operates within safe temperature ranges to prevent thermal runaway and degradation.

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Sensor Accuracy:** Utilize high-precision sensors to minimize measurement errors.
- **Sampling Rate:** Choose an appropriate sampling rate to capture rapid changes without overwhelming the system.
- **Data Storage:** Efficiently store acquired data for real-time processing and historical analysis.

### 2. SoC Calculation

**Objective:** Estimate the battery's State of Charge (SoC) using reliable methods such as Coulomb Counting or Open Circuit Voltage (OCV).

- **Coulomb Counting:** Integrates current over time to estimate charge transfer.
- **OCV Method:** Correlates open-circuit voltage with SoC based on the battery's discharge curve.

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Initial SoC Determination:** Accurate initial SoC is crucial to prevent error accumulation.
- **Temperature Compensation:** Adjust SoC calculations based on temperature variations affecting battery performance.

### 3. Cycle Identification

**Objective:** Detect charge and discharge events by analyzing changes in SoC to identify completed cycles.

- **Thresholds:** Define upper and lower SoC thresholds to determine when a cycle starts and ends.
- **Event Detection:** Monitor SoC transitions to identify the initiation and completion of cycles.

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Debouncing:** Implement mechanisms to avoid false cycle detections due to transient SoC fluctuations.
- **Noise Filtering:** Apply filters to smooth out SoC data for accurate event detection.

### 4. Depth of Discharge (DoD) Assessment

**Objective:** Determine the Depth of Discharge (DoD) for each cycle, as deeper discharges accelerate battery degradation.

- **Calculation:** DoD is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum SoC during a cycle.
  
  $$
  \text{DoD} = \frac{\text{SoC}_{\text{max}} - \text{SoC}_{\text{min}}}{\text{SoC}_{\text{max}}} \times 100\%
  $$

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **DoD Categorization:** Classify cycles based on DoD to weight their impact on SoH accordingly.
- **Partial Cycle Accumulation:** Aggregate partial cycles to form equivalent full cycles based on DoD.

### 5. Cycle Counting

**Objective:** Increment the cycle count based on identified full and equivalent partial cycles.

- **Equivalent Full Cycles:** Sum the DoD of partial cycles and convert them into full cycle equivalents.
  
  $$
  \text{Equivalent Full Cycles} = \frac{\sum \text{DoD}_i}{100\%}
  $$

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Cumulative Tracking:** Maintain a running total of equivalent full cycles for accurate SoH estimation.
- **Cycle Reset Mechanism:** Implement mechanisms to reset cycle counts if necessary, such as after maintenance or calibration.

### 6. SoH Estimation

**Objective:** Utilize the cycle count, DoD information, and manufacturer-provided degradation curves to estimate the current SoH.

- **Degradation Curves:** Manufacturers provide curves that relate the number of cycles and DoD to capacity loss.
- **Capacity Loss Calculation:** Estimate capacity loss based on accumulated equivalent full cycles and corresponding DoD.

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Dynamic Modeling:** Adjust SoH estimation models based on real-time usage patterns and environmental conditions.
- **Data Integration:** Combine cycle counting data with other SoH indicators like internal resistance for comprehensive health assessment.

## Factors Influencing Battery Degradation

Several factors impact battery degradation and should be considered in the SoH estimation process:

### Depth of Discharge (DoD)

- **Impact:** Deeper discharges subject batteries to increased stress, accelerating wear and capacity loss.
- **Mitigation:** Limit DoD through optimized charging strategies and battery management protocols.

### C-Rate

- **Definition:** The rate at which a battery is charged or discharged relative to its capacity.
- **Impact:** Higher C-rates can lead to increased stress, heat generation, and faster capacity loss.
- **Mitigation:** Implement charging and discharging rate limits to balance performance and longevity.

### Temperature

- **Impact:** Elevated temperatures accelerate chemical reactions leading to degradation, while extremely low temperatures can reduce battery performance and lifespan.
- **Mitigation:** Incorporate thermal management systems to maintain optimal operating temperatures.

### State of Charge (SoC) Range

- **Impact:** Operating a battery within certain SoC ranges can prolong its lifespan. Frequent cycling at high or low SoC extremes can contribute to faster degradation.
- **Mitigation:** Define and adhere to optimal SoC windows based on battery specifications.

## Advanced Considerations

While cycle counting provides a foundational approach to SoH estimation, integrating additional parameters can enhance accuracy:

### Coulombic Efficiency

- **Definition:** The ratio of charge output during discharge to charge input during charging.
- **Significance:** Monitoring Coulombic efficiency offers insights into internal losses and degradation mechanisms.
  
  $$
  \text{Coulombic Efficiency} = \frac{Q_{\text{out}}}{Q_{\text{in}}} \times 100\%
  $$

### Internal Resistance Measurement

- **Impact:** Increased internal resistance is indicative of battery aging, as it correlates with capacity loss and reduced efficiency.
- **Implementation:** Measure internal resistance periodically to serve as an additional SoH indicator.

### Machine Learning Models

- **Advantage:** Data-driven models can analyze complex patterns in battery usage and degradation data, improving SoH predictions.
- **Implementation:** Train machine learning algorithms on historical and real-time data to forecast battery health and lifespan.

## Code Snippets and Practical Implementations

        Initializes the CycleCounter with specified SoC thresholds.
        
        :param soc_threshold_upper: Upper SoC threshold (0 to 1)
        :param soc_threshold_lower: Lower SoC threshold (0 to 1)
        """
        self.soc_threshold_upper = soc_threshold_upper

        Updates the cycle count based on the current SoC.
        
        :param soc: Current State of Charge (0 to 1)
        """
        if soc >= self.soc_threshold_upper and not self.in_charge:
            self.in_charge = True
            self.in_discharge = False
            self.max_soc = soc
            print("Charge cycle started.")
        
        elif soc <= self.soc_threshold_lower and not self.in_discharge:
            self.in_discharge = True
            self.in_charge = False
            self.min_soc = soc
            print("Discharge cycle started.")
        
        if self.in_charge:
            if soc > self.max_soc:
                self.max_soc = soc
                print(f"New max SoC during charge: {self.max_soc * 100:.2f}%")
        
        if self.in_discharge:
            if soc < self.min_soc:

                print(f"New min SoC during discharge: {self.min_soc * 100:.2f}%")
        
        # Detect end of charge-discharge cycle
        if self.in_charge and soc <= self.soc_threshold_lower:
            self.in_charge = False
            self.in_discharge = True
            self.min_soc = soc
            doD = self.max_soc - self.min_soc
            self.equivalent_cycles += doD
            print(f"Charge-Discharge cycle completed with DoD: {doD * 100:.2f}%")
        
        elif self.in_discharge and soc >= self.soc_threshold_upper:

            doD = self.max_soc - self.min_soc
            self.equivalent_cycles += doD
            print(f"Discharge-Charge cycle completed with DoD: {doD * 100:.2f}%")

    def get_equivalent_cycles(self):
        """
        Returns the total equivalent full cycles.
        
        :return: Equivalent full cycles (float)
        """
        return self.equivalent_cycles

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cycle_counter = CycleCounter(soc_threshold_upper=0.9, soc_threshold_lower=0.1)
    soc_readings = [0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.85, 0.95, 0.9, 0.75, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1]

        cycle_counter.update_soc(soc)
    
    print(f"Total Equivalent Full Cycles: {cycle_counter.get_equivalent_cycles():.2f}")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Cycle Identification:** The `CycleCounter` class monitors SoC transitions between defined upper and lower thresholds to identify charge and discharge events.
- **DoD Calculation:** Upon completing a charge-discharge cycle, it calculates the Depth of Discharge (DoD) and accumulates it towards equivalent full cycles.
- **Equivalent Full Cycles:** Partial cycles are summed based on their DoD to provide an aggregated cycle count.

### 2. Depth of Discharge (DoD) Calculation

This snippet calculates the Depth of Discharge (DoD) for each detected cycle.

```python
def calculate_dod(max_soc, min_soc):
    """
    Calculates the Depth of Discharge (DoD) for a cycle.
    
    :param max_soc: Maximum State of Charge during the cycle (0 to 1)
    :param min_soc: Minimum State of Charge during the cycle (0 to 1)
    :return: DoD as a percentage (0 to 100)
    """
    dod = (max_soc - min_soc) * 100
    return dod

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    max_soc = 0.95
    min_soc = 0.15
    dod = calculate_dod(max_soc, min_soc)
    print(f"Depth of Discharge: {dod:.2f}%")
```

**Explanation:**

- **DoD Calculation:** Determines the percentage of battery capacity utilized during a charge-discharge cycle.
- **Usage:** Essential for weighting partial cycles in equivalent full cycle calculations.

### 3. SoH Estimation Based on Cycle Count and DoD

This example demonstrates how to estimate SoH using accumulated equivalent full cycles and manufacturer-provided degradation curves.

```python
class SoHEstimator:
    def __init__(self, degradation_curve):
        """
        Initializes the SoH Estimator with a degradation curve.
        
        :param degradation_curve: Dictionary mapping equivalent full cycles to SoH
        """
        self.degradation_curve = degradation_curve

    def estimate_soh(self, equivalent_cycles):
        """
        Estimates the State of Health (SoH) based on equivalent full cycles.
        
        :param equivalent_cycles: Total equivalent full cycles
        :return: Estimated SoH (0 to 1)
        """
        sorted_cycles = sorted(self.degradation_curve.keys())
        for cycle in sorted_cycles:
            if equivalent_cycles < cycle:
                return self.degradation_curve[cycle]
        # If cycles exceed provided data, extrapolate or set minimum SoH
        return self.degradation_curve[sorted_cycles[-1]]

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define a sample degradation curve (cycles: SoH)
    degradation_curve = {
        0: 1.0,
        500: 0.9,
        1000: 0.8,
        1500: 0.7,
        2000: 0.6
    }

    soh_estimator = SoHEstimator(degradation_curve)

    # Suppose we have accumulated 750 equivalent full cycles
    equivalent_cycles = 750
    estimated_soh = soh_estimator.estimate_soh(equivalent_cycles)
    print(f"Estimated SoH: {estimated_soh * 100:.2f}%")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Degradation Curve:** Represents the relationship between equivalent full cycles and SoH as provided by the battery manufacturer.
- **SoH Estimation:** Uses the accumulated equivalent full cycles to interpolate or extrapolate the current SoH based on the degradation curve.

        """
        Initializes the Battery with specified parameters.
        
        :param nominal_capacity: Battery capacity in Ampere-hours (Ah)
        :param degradation_curve: Dictionary mapping equivalent full cycles to SoH
        :param soc_threshold_upper: Upper SoC threshold for cycle identification
        :param soc_threshold_lower: Lower SoC threshold for cycle identification
        """
        self.nominal_capacity = nominal_capacity
        self.degradation_curve = degradation_curve
        self.cycle_counter = CycleCounter(soc_threshold_upper, soc_threshold_lower)
        self.soh_estimator = SoHEstimator(degradation_curve)
        self.equivalent_cycles = 0.0

    def process_soc(self, soc):
        """
        Processes the current SoC reading for cycle counting.
        
        :param soc: Current State of Charge (0 to 1)
        """
        self.cycle_counter.update_soc(soc)
        self.equivalent_cycles = self.cycle_counter.get_equivalent_cycles()

    def estimate_soh(self):
        """
        Estimates the current State of Health (SoH).
        
        :return: Estimated SoH (0 to 1)
        """
        return self.soh_estimator.estimate_soh(self.equivalent_cycles)

# Define the CycleCounter and SoHEstimator classes as previously

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    # Define degradation curve
    degradation_curve = {
        0: 1.0,
        500: 0.9,
        1000: 0.8,
        1500: 0.7,
        2000: 0.6
    }
    
    # Initialize Battery
    nominal_capacity = 2.0  # Ah
    battery = Battery(nominal_capacity, degradation_curve)
    
    # Simulate SoC readings over time
    soc_readings = [
        0.1, 0.15, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7, 0.85, 0.95, 0.9, 0.75, 0.6, 0.4, 0.2, 0.1,
        0.15, 0.25, 0.45, 0.65, 0.85, 0.95, 0.85, 0.7, 0.5, 0.3, 0.1
    ]
    
    for soc in soc_readings:
        battery.process_soc(soc)
    
    estimated_soh = battery.estimate_soh()
    print(f"Total Equivalent Full Cycles: {battery.equivalent_cycles:.2f}")
    print(f"Estimated State of Health (SoH): {estimated_soh * 100:.2f}%")
```

**Explanation:**

- **Battery Class:** Integrates cycle counting and SoH estimation, encapsulating the entire process.
- **Processing SoC:** For each SoC reading, the cycle counter updates the equivalent cycle count.
- **SoH Estimation:** After processing all SoC readings, the battery estimates its current SoH based on accumulated cycles.
- **Simulation:** The example simulates a series of SoC readings that include both full and partial cycles, demonstrating how equivalent full cycles are accumulated and how SoH is estimated accordingly.

## Conclusion

**Cycle Counting** is a fundamental method for estimating the **State of Health (SoH)** of batteries, particularly in applications where battery reliability and longevity are critical, such as electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. By meticulously tracking charge-discharge cycles and accounting for factors like Depth of Discharge (DoD), Cycle Counting provides valuable insights into battery aging and capacity degradation.

While Cycle Counting offers a straightforward approach to SoH estimation, it is susceptible to cumulative errors due to sensor inaccuracies and integration drift. To enhance accuracy, it is essential to implement periodic calibration using methods like the Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) technique and incorporate additional indicators such as Coulombic Efficiency and Internal Resistance measurements. Advanced techniques, including machine learning models, can further refine SoH predictions by analyzing complex patterns in battery usage and degradation data.

Integrating Cycle Counting within a comprehensive BMS framework, alongside other diagnostic and prognostic tools, ensures reliable battery performance, optimizes maintenance schedules, and extends the overall lifespan of battery systems. As battery technologies continue to evolve, the role of sophisticated SoH estimation algorithms will become increasingly pivotal in meeting the demands of modern energy storage solutions.
