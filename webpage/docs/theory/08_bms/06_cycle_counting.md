# Cycle Counting and SOH

Cycle counting is a fundamental method for estimating the State of Health (SoH) of batteries, particularly in applications like electric vehicles and renewable energy storage systems. This approach involves tracking the number of charge-discharge cycles a battery undergoes, as each cycle contributes to the battery's aging and capacity degradation.

**Understanding Battery Cycles:**

A full charge-discharge cycle is defined as charging a battery from a lower State of Charge (SoC) to its maximum capacity and then discharging it back to the initial SoC. In practical applications, batteries often experience partial cycles, where they are charged and discharged within a specific SoC range rather than from 0% to 100%. To account for these partial cycles, the concept of equivalent full cycles is used, which aggregates partial cycles into full cycle equivalents for accurate SoH estimation.

**Cycle Counting Algorithm:**

Implementing a cycle counting algorithm involves several key steps:

1. **Data Acquisition:** Continuously monitor and record the battery's voltage, current, and temperature during operation.

2. **SoC Calculation:** Estimate the battery's SoC using methods such as coulomb counting, which integrates the current over time, or by measuring the open-circuit voltage.

3. **Cycle Identification:** Detect charge and discharge events by analyzing changes in SoC. A full cycle is identified when the battery transitions from a lower SoC threshold to an upper SoC threshold and back. Partial cycles are tracked and accumulated to form equivalent full cycles.

4. **Depth of Discharge (DoD) Assessment:** Determine the DoD for each cycle, as deeper discharges can accelerate battery degradation. DoD is calculated as the difference between the maximum and minimum SoC during a cycle.

5. **Cycle Counting:** Increment the cycle count based on the identified full and equivalent partial cycles.

6. **SoH Estimation:** Utilize the cycle count, DoD information, and manufacturer-provided degradation curves to estimate the current SoH. These curves relate the number of cycles and DoD to capacity loss, enabling the prediction of remaining battery life.

**Factors Influencing Battery Degradation:**

Several factors impact battery degradation and should be considered in the SoH estimation process:

- **Depth of Discharge (DoD):** Deeper discharges subject batteries to increased stress, accelerating wear and capacity loss. 

- **C-Rate:** The rate at which a battery is charged or discharged (C-rate) affects its degradation. Higher C-rates can lead to increased stress and faster capacity loss. 

- **Temperature:** Operating temperatures significantly influence battery aging. Elevated temperatures can accelerate degradation, while extremely low temperatures can also have adverse effects. 

- **State of Charge (SoC) Range:** Operating a battery within certain SoC ranges can prolong its lifespan. Frequent cycling at high or low SoC extremes can contribute to faster degradation. 

**Advanced Considerations:**

While cycle counting provides a foundational approach to SoH estimation, integrating additional parameters can enhance accuracy:

- **Coulombic Efficiency:** Monitoring the ratio of charge output during discharge to charge input during charging can offer insights into internal losses and degradation mechanisms. 

- **Internal Resistance:** Measuring changes in internal resistance over time can serve as an indicator of aging, as increased resistance often correlates with capacity loss. 

- **Machine Learning Models:** Employing data-driven models can improve SoH predictions by analyzing complex patterns in battery usage and degradation data. 

In summary, cycle counting is a practical method for estimating battery SoH, especially when combined with other diagnostic tools and models. By accurately tracking charge-discharge cycles and considering factors like DoD, C-rate, temperature, and SoC ranges, it's possible to assess battery health and predict remaining useful life effectively.
