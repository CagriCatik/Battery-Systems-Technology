# BMS Algorithms

Battery Management Systems (BMS) are integral to the operation of lithium-ion batteries, ensuring safety, optimizing performance, and extending battery life. Central to a BMS are algorithms that monitor and manage various battery parameters. This documentation delves into the primary algorithms employed in BMS, providing detailed explanations and relevant code snippets to enhance understanding.

## State of Charge (SoC) Estimation

The State of Charge (SoC) represents the remaining capacity of a battery as a percentage of its total capacity. Accurate SoC estimation is crucial for predicting the remaining runtime and ensuring efficient battery utilization. Several methods are employed for SoC estimation:

### Coulomb Counting Method

This method involves integrating the current over time to estimate the charge transferred in and out of the battery. While straightforward, it is susceptible to cumulative errors due to sensor inaccuracies and requires periodic calibration.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def coulomb_counting(current_readings, time_interval, initial_soc, battery_capacity):
    """
    Estimate SoC using Coulomb Counting method.

    :param current_readings: List of current measurements (in Amperes)
    :param time_interval: Time between measurements (in seconds)
    :param initial_soc: Initial State of Charge (0 to 1)
    :param battery_capacity: Battery capacity in Ampere-seconds (As)
    :return: Estimated SoC (0 to 1)
    """
    charge_accumulated = sum(current * time_interval for current in current_readings)
    soc = initial_soc - (charge_accumulated / battery_capacity)
    return max(0, min(1, soc))  # Ensure SoC is within 0 to 1
```

### Open Circuit Voltage (OCV) Method

The OCV method estimates SoC based on the battery's open-circuit voltage, which correlates with its charge level. This method requires the battery to be at rest to obtain accurate voltage measurements, limiting its applicability during active operation.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def ocv_to_soc(ocv, ocv_soc_map):
    """
    Estimate SoC based on Open Circuit Voltage (OCV).

    :param ocv: Measured open circuit voltage
    :param ocv_soc_map: Dictionary mapping OCV values to SoC
    :return: Estimated SoC (0 to 1)
    """
    # Find the closest OCV value in the map
    closest_ocv = min(ocv_soc_map.keys(), key=lambda k: abs(k - ocv))
    return ocv_soc_map[closest_ocv]
```

### Kalman Filter Method

Kalman Filters provide a robust approach to SoC estimation by combining measurements from various sensors and accounting for system noise. They offer improved accuracy over time, adapting to changes in battery behavior.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
import numpy as np

def kalman_filter_soc(current, voltage, soc_prev, P_prev, Q, R, dt, C, G):
    """
    Estimate SoC using a simplified Kalman Filter approach.

    :param current: Measured current (A)
    :param voltage: Measured voltage (V)
    :param soc_prev: Previous SoC estimate
    :param P_prev: Previous error covariance
    :param Q: Process noise covariance
    :param R: Measurement noise covariance
    :param dt: Time step (s)
    :param C: Battery capacity (As)
    :param G: Gain factor
    :return: Updated SoC estimate and error covariance
    """
    # Predict
    soc_pred = soc_prev - (current * dt / C)
    P_pred = P_prev + Q

    # Update
    K = P_pred / (P_pred + R)
    soc_est = soc_pred + K * (voltage - soc_pred)
    P_est = (1 - K) * P_pred

    return soc_est, P_est
```

## State of Health (SoH) Estimation

State of Health (SoH) indicates the overall condition of a battery relative to its ideal state, often expressed as a percentage. Accurate SoH estimation is vital for predicting battery lifespan and scheduling maintenance.

### Capacity Fade Analysis

This method tracks the reduction in battery capacity over time to estimate SoH. By comparing the current capacity to the nominal capacity, the degree of degradation can be assessed.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def soh_capacity_fade(nominal_capacity, measured_capacity):
    """
    Estimate SoH based on capacity fade.

    :param nominal_capacity: Original battery capacity (Ah)
    :param measured_capacity: Current measured capacity (Ah)
    :return: Estimated SoH (0 to 1)
    """
    soh = measured_capacity / nominal_capacity
    return max(0, min(1, soh))  # Ensure SoH is within 0 to 1
```

### Internal Resistance Method

An increase in internal resistance is indicative of battery aging. By measuring the internal resistance and comparing it to the initial value, SoH can be inferred.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def soh_internal_resistance(initial_resistance, current_resistance):
    """
    Estimate SoH based on internal resistance increase.

    :param initial_resistance: Initial internal resistance (Ohms)
    :param current_resistance: Current internal resistance (Ohms)
    :return: Estimated SoH (0 to 1)
    """
    resistance_increase = current_resistance - initial_resistance
    soh = 1 - (resistance_increase / initial_resistance)
    return max(0, min(1, soh))  # Ensure SoH is within 0 to 1
```

## State of Power (SoP) Estimation

State of Power (SoP) refers to the maximum power output a battery can deliver at a given time. Estimating SoP is essential for applications requiring high power demands, ensuring the battery can meet performance requirements without compromising safety.

### Model-Based Estimation

This approach utilizes battery models, such as equivalent circuit models, to predict the maximum deliverable power based on current SoC, temperature, and other parameters.

**Code Snippet:**

```python
def sop_model_based(soc, temperature, model_parameters):
    """
    Estimate SoP using a model-based approach.

    :param soc: Current State of Charge (0 to 1)
    :param temperature: Battery temperature (Â°C)
    :param model_parameters: Dictionary containing model-specific parameters
    :return: Estimated SoP (W)
    """
    # Example model: SoP decreases linearly with
