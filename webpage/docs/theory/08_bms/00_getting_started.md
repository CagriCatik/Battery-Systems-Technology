# Getting Started

A Battery Management System is a critical component in modern energy storage solutions. It is responsible for ensuring the safe, efficient, and reliable operation of rechargeable batteries, typically found in electric vehicles (EVs), energy storage systems, and portable devices.


1. **Monitoring**:
   - Tracks key parameters such as voltage, current, and temperature of individual cells and the entire battery pack.
   
2. **Control**:
   - Manages charging and discharging operations to prevent overcharging or deep discharging, which can damage the battery.

3. **Protection**:
   - Protects the battery pack from unsafe operating conditions such as thermal runaway, overvoltage, and short circuits.

4. **Estimation**:
   - Computes essential battery metrics, such as the State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), and remaining cycle life.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Balances individual cells in the battery pack to ensure uniform performance and prolong overall battery lifespan.
