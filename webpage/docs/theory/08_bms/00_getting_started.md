# Getting Started

1. **Monitoring**:
   - Tracks key parameters such as voltage, current, and temperature of individual cells and the entire battery pack.
   
2. **Control**:
   - Manages charging and discharging operations to prevent overcharging or deep discharging, which can damage the battery.

3. **Protection**:
   - Protects the battery pack from unsafe operating conditions such as thermal runaway, overvoltage, and short circuits.

4. **Estimation**:
   - Computes essential battery metrics, such as the State of Charge (SOC), State of Health (SOH), and remaining cycle life.

5. **Optimization**:
   - Balances individual cells in the battery pack to ensure uniform performance and prolong overall battery lifespan.
