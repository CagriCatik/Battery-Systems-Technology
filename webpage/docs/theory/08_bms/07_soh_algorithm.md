## Cycle Counting Method for SoH Estimation

The **Cycle Counting Method** is a fundamental approach for estimating the **State of Health (SoH)** of batteries by tracking the number of charge-discharge cycles a battery undergoes. Each cycle contributes to the natural aging process of the battery, leading to capacity fade and increased internal resistance.

### Understanding Battery Cycles

#### What Constitutes a Battery Cycle?

A **battery cycle** refers to the process of charging a battery from a lower **State of Charge (SoC)** to its maximum capacity and then discharging it back to the initial SoC. In practical applications, batteries rarely undergo full cycles; instead, they experience **partial cycles**, where they are charged and discharged within specific SoC ranges.

**Equivalent Full Cycles:**

To account for partial cycles, the concept of **equivalent full cycles** is employed. This metric aggregates partial cycles into full cycle equivalents based on the cumulative **Depth of Discharge (DoD)**. For example, two 50% partial cycles equate to one full cycle.

#### Importance of Cycle Counting

- **SoH Estimation:** Provides a direct correlation between usage and battery aging.
- **Maintenance Scheduling:** Helps in planning timely maintenance and replacements.
- **Performance Optimization:** Assists in understanding usage patterns to optimize charging strategies and prolong battery lifespan.

### Implementing Cycle Counting

Implementing a **Cycle Counting** algorithm involves several critical steps to ensure accurate SoH estimation. Below are the detailed steps required for effective cycle counting.

#### Data Acquisition

**Objective:** Continuously monitor and record the battery's operational parameters, such as voltage, current, and temperature.

**Key Parameters to Monitor:**

**Calculation:**

$$
\text{Equivalent Full Cycles} = \frac{\sum \text{DoD}_i}{100\%}
$$

Where:

- $ \text{DoD}_i $ represents the DoD of each individual cycle.

**Implementation Considerations:**

- **Cumulative Tracking:** Maintain a running total of equivalent full cycles for accurate SoH estimation.
- **Cycle Reset Mechanism:** Implement mechanisms to reset cycle counts if necessary, such as after maintenance or calibration.

#### SoH Estimation

**Objective:** Utilize the cycle count, DoD information, and manufacturer-provided degradation curves to estimate the current SoH.

**Approach:**

- **Degradation Curves:** Manufacturers provide curves that relate the number of cycles and DoD to capacity loss.
- **Capacity Loss Calculation:** Estimate capacity loss based on accumulated equivalent full cycles and corresponding DoD.

**Implementation Considerations:**

### Mitigation Strategies

To enhance the accuracy of the Cycle Counting Method, it is often combined with other SoH estimation techniques, such as model-based or data-driven approaches. Additionally, implementing temperature compensation, dynamic threshold adjustments, and sensor calibration routines can mitigate some of the method's limitations.

## Enhancements and Advanced Techniques

To overcome the limitations of the basic Cycle Counting Method and improve SoH estimation accuracy, several enhancements and advanced techniques can be integrated.

### Coulombic Efficiency Monitoring

        return self.equivalent_cycles

# Example Usage
if __name__ == "__main__":
    cycle_counter = CycleCounter(soc_threshold_upper=0.9, soc_threshold_lower=0.1)

        1500: 0.7,
        2000: 0.6
    }

    soh_estimator = SoHEstimator(degradation_curve)

    # Suppose we have accumulated 750 equivalent full cycles
    equivalent_cycles = 750
    estimated_soh = soh_estimator.estimate_soh(equivalent_cycles)
    print(f"Estimated SoH: {estimated_soh * 100:.2f}%")
