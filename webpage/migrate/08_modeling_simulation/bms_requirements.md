## Introduction

Battery Management Systems (BMS) are vital for the safe and efficient operation of battery-powered systems. They monitor parameters such as voltage, current, and temperature while implementing control strategies to optimize performance and safety. Effective management of requirements is essential for the success of BMS projects, as poorly defined or managed requirements often lead to failures in embedded systems projects. Simulink offers a unified environment that addresses these challenges by integrating requirements management with model-based design, enabling engineers to maintain alignment between requirements and design throughout the development lifecycle.

### Importance of Requirements Management for BMS

Battery Management Systems are integral to ensuring the reliability, efficiency, and safety of modern battery-powered applications. They monitor and control key parameters, such as voltage, current, temperature, and charge/discharge cycles, to prevent failures and optimize performance. However, poor requirements management, such as missing, incomplete, or inconsistent requirements, remains a leading cause of embedded project failures. 

This document explores how Simulink enhances the process of managing requirements for BMS, with tools for integration, traceability, and design validation, minimizing errors and improving project outcomes.

## Requirements Management Workflow in Simulink

### 1. Importing External Requirements

External requirements, typically documented in Word, Excel, or specialized tools like DOORS, describe the high-level architecture and detailed specifications of the BMS. These documents can include descriptions of input/output interfaces, control module interactions, and software functionalities. Simulink facilitates the import process through the Requirements Manager. After selecting the external document and specifying import settings (rich text or plain text), the requirements are imported into the Requirements Editor. Updates from the source document can be synchronized to reflect changes, ensuring the design remains consistent with the latest requirements.

External requirements are often authored in tools like Microsoft Word or Excel, describing the high-level system architecture, interfaces, and detailed specifications for modules. Simulink simplifies importing these requirements:

1. Open the **Requirements Manager** from the Simulink toolbar.
2. Use the **Requirements Editor** to:
   - Browse and select the external document.
   - Specify text format (Rich Text or Plain Text).
   - Enable updates from the external source for synchronization.
3. Assign a name to the requirement set and click **Import**.

**Outcome:** The imported requirements appear in the Requirements Editor, where they can be expanded and reviewed in detail.

---

### 2. Synchronizing Updates

Simulink tracks changes in external requirement sources. If an external document is modified:

1. Simulink notifies the user with an update icon.
2. Click the **Update** button in the Requirements Manager.
3. Confirm synchronization to refresh the requirements in Simulink.

**Benefit:** This ensures the design reflects the latest requirements without manual re-entry.

### 3. Authoring Requirements Directly in Simulink

For projects requiring iterative development or refinement of requirements, Simulink allows engineers to author requirements directly within the environment. By creating a new requirement set in the Requirements Editor, engineers can define requirements, organize them hierarchically, and add attributes such as descriptions, priorities, and verification status. This approach streamlines the development process by consolidating all requirements-related tasks in a single environment, reducing the risk of misalignment or oversight.

Simulink allows users to define requirements directly within the environment:

1. Create a **Requirement Set** in the Requirements Editor.
2. Add requirements with hierarchical structures:
   - Define parent-child relationships.
   - Include summaries and descriptions for each requirement.
3. Customize attributes, such as priority, verification status, or additional metadata.

**Advantages:**  
- Provides flexibility to tailor requirements during iterative development.
- Supports detailed documentation and organization of low-level requirements.

### 4. Linking Requirements to Design

Establishing traceability between requirements and design is critical for validating system functionality. Simulink enables bi-directional linking between high-level and low-level requirements, design elements, and state machine logic. Engineers can link requirements to Simulink blocks, Stateflow states, or transitions by dragging and dropping the requirement onto the corresponding design element. Links are visually represented on the Simulink canvas, providing immediate feedback on traceability.

High-level requirements, such as system architecture, can be linked to control modules, while low-level requirements are mapped to specific design components. This linkage ensures that all design elements are traceable back to their source requirements, facilitating validation and verification.

#### Bi-Directional Linking

Establishing links between requirements and design ensures traceability:

1. **Linking Requirements to Simulink Blocks:**
   - Drag and drop a requirement onto a Simulink block.
   - Confirm the link is established by observing the link icon on the block.

2. **Linking High-Level to Low-Level Requirements:**
   - Select a high-level requirement, right-click, and create a link to a low-level requirement.
   - Verify the link in the bottom-right Requirements Browser.

#### Examples:
- High-level system architecture linked to corresponding control modules.
- Stateflow states and transitions linked to functional requirements.

### 5. Integrated View of Requirements and Design

Simulink's Requirements Perspective provides a unified view of requirements and design elements. By activating the Requirements Browser and Property Inspector, engineers can visualize the relationship between requirements and design in a single interface. This integrated view enables engineers to analyze requirements in the context of the system architecture, ensuring alignment and consistency. For example, while examining state machine logic, engineers can verify that each state and transition adheres to the linked requirements.

Simulink offers a unified perspective to visualize requirements alongside design:

1. Activate the **Requirements Perspective** by enabling:
   - **Requirements Browser**: Displays all requirements.
   - **Property Inspector**: Shows attributes of linked elements.

2. Navigate through requirements and design elements to ensure consistency.

**Use Case:** While analyzing state machine logic, designers can verify that states and transitions adhere to their respective requirements.

### 6. Progress Tracking and Reporting

Monitoring the status of requirement implementation is essential for project transparency and accountability. Simulink offers a progress tracking feature within the Requirements Browser, allowing engineers to assess the implementation status of each requirement. Requirements linked to design elements are marked as complete, while unlinked or partially implemented requirements are flagged as pending. This feature provides a clear overview of project progress, enabling project managers to identify bottlenecks and allocate resources effectively.

For instance, input and output interface requirements may be marked as complete once linked to corresponding Simulink blocks and verified against their specifications. Conversely, state machine logic requirements may remain pending until all states and transitions are fully implemented and validated.

#### Monitoring Implementation Status
Simulink supports tracking the status of requirement implementation:

1. Enable the **Progress Column** in the Requirements Browser.
2. View the implementation status:
   - **Complete**: Fully linked and verified requirements.
   - **Pending**: Unlinked or partially implemented requirements.

#### Example:
- Input/output interface requirements marked as complete after proper linking.
- State machine logic flagged as pending until all transitions are linked.
