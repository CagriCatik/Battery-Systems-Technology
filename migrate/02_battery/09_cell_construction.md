### Key Components of a Battery Cell

At the heart of every battery cell lie three essential components: the cathode, anode, and separator. The cathode, serving as the positive terminal, is engineered to facilitate the movement of electrons during the discharge process. Typically composed of materials such as lithium cobalt oxide (LiCoO₂) or lithium iron phosphate (LiFePO₄), the cathode's composition is critical in determining the cell's voltage and energy density. The anode, the negative terminal, is responsible for providing electrons during discharge and is commonly made from graphite or other carbon-based materials, although advancements have introduced silicon-based anodes to enhance capacity.

Interspersed between the cathode and anode is the separator, a meticulously designed insulating layer that prevents direct electrical contact between the two electrodes. This separator is crafted from porous materials like polyethylene or polypropylene, allowing for the unobstructed flow of ions while ensuring electrical isolation. The separator's integrity is vital for maintaining the cell's safety and longevity, as it mitigates the risk of short circuits and thermal runaway.

A battery cell consists of three primary components:

1. **Cathode (Positive Terminal)**  
   The cathode is the positively charged electrode that facilitates the movement of electrons during discharge.

2. **Anode (Negative Terminal)**  
   The anode is the negatively charged electrode that provides electrons during discharge.

3. **Separator**  
   A separator is a thin, insulating layer that prevents direct contact between the cathode and anode while allowing ionic flow.

### Cylindrical Cells

Cylindrical cells are renowned for their robust construction and reliability, making them a staple in various applications ranging from consumer electronics to electric vehicles. The structural design of cylindrical cells employs a rolled or "jelly-roll" configuration, where alternating layers of cathode, separator, and anode are meticulously stacked and then tightly wound into a cylindrical shape. This method not only maximizes the surface area for electrochemical reactions but also ensures uniformity and structural stability.

Encased within a durable metal shell, typically aluminum or steel, the cylindrical cell's exterior serves as the negative terminal, providing both mechanical protection and electrical conductivity. The metal casing is designed to withstand significant mechanical stress and thermal fluctuations, thereby enhancing the cell's overall resilience. The top of the cylindrical cell is usually insulated with a plastic cap, ensuring safe handling and preventing accidental short circuits.

From an electrical standpoint, cylindrical cells exhibit predictable performance characteristics. When interfacing with external circuitry, the positive terminal is accessed via the insulated top, while the metal casing functions as the negative terminal. This configuration simplifies the integration process, as the robust metal casing can efficiently conduct electricity with minimal resistance. However, it is crucial to maintain the integrity of the cell's insulation; any compromise can lead to exposure of the metal casing, potentially resulting in electrical hazards or diminished cell performance.

#### Structural Design
Cylindrical cells are constructed in a rolled or "jelly-roll" configuration:
- Layers of the cathode, separator, and anode are stacked and rolled into a cylindrical shape, similar to how steel sheets are rolled for transportation.
- The rolled structure is encased in a metal shell, which serves as the cell's negative terminal.

#### Advantages
- The outer casing is robust and conductive, simplifying the design for connecting to the circuit.
- The top of the cell is typically plastic-insulated, ensuring safety during handling.

#### Electrical Potential
- When measured with a voltmeter:
  - The positive terminal of the voltmeter is placed on the top terminal.
  - The negative terminal can be placed on the outer metal casing to measure the cell's voltage.
- If the insulation on the outer surface is compromised, the metal casing can exhibit the cell's full potential.

### Prismatic Cells

Prismatic cells offer a distinct alternative to cylindrical cells, characterized by their rectangular, notebook-like form factor. This design leverages a flat and stacked arrangement of the cathode, separator, and anode layers, encased within rigid materials such as plastic or cardboard-like composites. The prismatic structure is meticulously engineered to optimize space utilization, making it particularly advantageous for applications where compactness and efficient packaging are paramount, such as in portable electronics and electric vehicles.

A notable feature of prismatic cells is the incorporation of an open pressure band, a critical safety mechanism designed to mitigate the risks associated with internal gas buildup. During normal operation, minor gas generation is anticipated; however, under conditions of excessive pressure, the open pressure band activates to release the accumulated gases, thereby preventing potential cell rupture or thermal runaway. This safety feature underscores the sophisticated engineering embedded within prismatic cells to ensure reliable and safe operation.

Connectivity in prismatic cells is facilitated through the use of screw terminals, which allow for secure and straightforward attachment to external circuits. The current collectors, or tabs, are typically composed of aluminum for the cathode and copper for the anode, chosen for their excellent electrical conductivity and compatibility with the cell's electrochemical processes. These tabs are integral in maintaining efficient electron flow and minimizing internal resistance, thereby enhancing the cell's overall performance.

#### Structural Design
Prismatic cells resemble a notebook:
- The "covers" are made of hard materials, such as cardboard-like casings, to provide structural integrity.
- The "pages" inside consist of stacked layers of the cathode, separator, and anode, arranged in a flat, rectangular format.

#### Features
