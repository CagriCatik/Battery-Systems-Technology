## 4. Mathematical Representation

The voltage \( V(t) \) across the battery is expressed as:
$$
V(t) = OCV - I \cdot R_0 - V_{\text{RC1}} - V_{\text{RC2}}
$$

Where:
- $$\( OCV \)$$: Open Circuit Voltage.
- $$\( I \)$$: Current (positive for discharge, negative for charge).
- $$\( R_0 \)$$: Ohmic resistance.
- $$\( V_{\text{RC1}} \)$$ and $$\( V_{\text{RC2}} \)$$: Voltages across the first and second RC circuits.

### Dynamic Behavior
The voltage across each RC branch is governed by:
$$
\frac{dV_{\text{RC}}}{dt} = \frac{I}{C} - \frac{V_{\text{RC}}}{R \cdot C}
$$

Where:
- $$\( R \)$$: Resistance in the RC network.
- $$\( C \)$$: Capacitance in the RC network.

## Example Calculation: Voltage Across RC Circuit

For an RC circuit with \( R = 10 \, \Omega \) and \( C = 100 \, \mu F \), and an input current \( I = 2 \, A \):

$$
\frac{dV_{\text{RC}}}{dt} = \frac{2}{100 \times 10^{-6}} - \frac{V_{\text{RC}}}{10 \cdot 100 \times 10^{-6}}
$$

Solving this equation provides the time-dependent voltage across the capacitor.
