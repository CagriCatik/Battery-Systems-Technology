<h3 class="anchor anchorWithStickyNavbar_LWe7" id="3-pouch-cells">3. Pouch Cells<a href="#3-pouch-cells" class="hash-link" aria-label="Direct link to 3. Pouch Cells" title="Direct link to 3. Pouch Cells">​</a></h3>
<p>Pouch cells represent a flexible alternative to both cylindrical and prismatic designs, utilizing a flexible, laminated casing instead of a rigid outer shell. This flexibility grants pouch cells a lightweight and adaptable form factor, making them ideal for applications that demand both portability and customization, such as consumer electronics, drones, and certain automotive applications. The high gravimetric energy density of pouch cells ensures that they can store a significant amount of energy relative to their weight, which is crucial for applications where reducing weight is a priority.</p>
<p>Despite their advantages, pouch cells are more susceptible to mechanical damage due to their lack of rigid protection. The flexible casing makes them prone to punctures and deformations, which can compromise the cell&#x27;s integrity and lead to safety hazards. Additionally, the thermal management requirements for pouch cells are more complex, as their flexible nature can impede effective heat dissipation. Advanced engineering solutions are necessary to address these challenges, ensuring that pouch cells can operate safely and efficiently under varying conditions.</p>
